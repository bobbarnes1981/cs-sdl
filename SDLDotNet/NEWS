===4.0.1===
David Hudson 16 Dec 2005 

This release fixes numerous bugs in the library, particularly in the Events class. The Events loop now supports OpenGL applications better. OpenGL attributes can now be accessed using properties. User-defined events work much better. Creating Resizable windows is much easier. A Wiki-version of OpenGL Red Book was added to the SDL.NET website.

Many thanks to dogwatch for submitting numerous bug reports.
* Fixed Surface.TransparentColor not being retained after rotating Surface.
* Fixed Alpha not being retained after rotating Surface.
* Fixed problem with GetPixel getting wrong pixel.
* Removed Surface() default constructor. It required that Video.SetVideoMode be called first which led to confusion since the other constructors do not require the call.
* Added a User Event mask to EventMask enum.
* Added PumpEvents() before PeepEvents() in the Events.Remove() method.
* Added a Events.Retrieve() set of methods.
* Events Ticker is no longer multithreaded. This fixed a problem where OpenGL contexts would not work with the Event ticker.
* Tick Event handlers are now removed when the Events.QuitApplication() method is called. This help the NeHe demos close a lesson's SDL window then start a new one.
* Video.SetVideoMode can use the Resizable parameter much more easily.
* All OpenGL demos (NeHe and Gears) now use the Events ticker. The NeHe lesson dialog can close and start lessons more cleanly.
* UserEvents work. Users can now define new UserEvents and put them into the Event queue.
* Sound.Fadeout works.
* Font check for empty string has been fixed.
* Rectangles and Gears demos are now resizable.
* Cleaned up Gears code.
* All of the EventArgs classes have been revised. No API changes but the code is much cleaner.
* All OpenGL attributes can now be accessed using properties.
* Removed IsInitialized() from subsystems due to problem with the method.
* Removed Dispose() from Video, Timer, CDRom, Mixer and Joysticks since they do not actually implement IDisposable and are singletons. Also, the methods did not work correctly. The Close() method for each singleton class will shut down the SDL subsystems.
* Very minor AnimatedSprite fix.
* Added OpenGL Programming Guide Red Book to the Wiki.
* TransparentColor and Alpha properties now exist in Sprite and SurfaceCollection to make life easier.

3.1.2
David Hudson 18 July 2005
* Added a more sophisticated SpriteCollection.Draw() method. It now mirrors the RenderUpdate() method in PyGame. You can clear and update just the rects that changed.
* Fixed major bug with the SpriteCollection/Sprite Add() and Remove() methods. They were causing Dispose() problems.
* Fixed problems with LostSprites in SpriteCollections. This allows the old Rects to be cleared properly.
* Removed WeaponFire and Bounce examples. WeaponFire has been integrated into BombRun (press the space bar to fire).
* The BounceSprites example will remove a ball if you right click on it. This uses the Sprite.Kill()/Remove() methods.
* Updated to Sdl_mixer 1.2.6
* Created Windows installer.
* Added many NeHe OpenGL examples.

3.1.1
David Hudson 21 June 2005
* Added Surface.Stretch. This allows surfaces to be stretched to fit a given rectangle. This much requested feature was very helpful for the CEGUI renderer.
* Added new Scale, Rotation, Zoom methods that return a new Surface instead of modifying current Surface. This issue was brought up by an example from Cibressus.
* Updated Tao.Sdl and Tao.OpenGl

3.1.0
David Hudson 18 May 2005
* Surface is now Clonable, both shallow and deep.
* Added Transformation object to help rotate, zoom or scale Surfaces.
* Added BounceSprite demo and tutorial

3.1.0beta1
David Hudson 13 May 2005
* Fixed several memory leaks.
* Added two tutorials. SimpleExample is from Terry Price and ParticleEngine is from Miguel De Sousa.
* Made the VideoModes flags into an enum.
* The Surface.Fill() method now returns the updated rectangles instead of void
* Many more FXCop fixes.
* GUI demo works but is not complete. It still has memory leaks and missing functionality.
* Fixed major color bug in Surface primitives.
* Removed some redundant enums from SdlFlags.
* Fixed problems with Surface constructors.
* Removed ChannelList class.
* TODO: Sprite tutorial.

3.1.0alpha1
David Hudson 27 Apr 2005
**** Note that this is definitely an alpha. Feedback will be greatly appreciated. ****
* New sprite engine. Based on pygame and includes some ideas from Moonfire's demo
* Moonfire's GUI system and demo have been reworked to use new sprite engine. This still needs a lot of work.
* VideoInfo is now a proper singleton.
* Added some new overloads and a constructor to Surface.
* All Windows dll dependencies are now included in the zip file under the /lib.win32deps directory. You no longer need to download Tao.Sdl.deps separately.
* Fixed some memory issues pointed out by scottles2. Note that there are still some memory leaks.
* Used FXCop to clean up many issues.
* Removed Bitstream fonts from FontExample. Added FSF GPL fonts.
* Consolidated a few of the examples. Renamed Moonfire's demo. 
* Removed some of Moonfire's examples that were not relating to SDL.NET.

3.0.0
David Hudson 23 Feb 2005
* Exceptions will use the SDL_error string by default.
* Primitives are antialiased by default.
* Fixed some documentation.

3.0.0beta2
David Hudson 20 Feb 2005
* Updated some of the documentation.
* Added Triad, a Tetris-like game to the examples directory. It was created by Michael Rosario.
* Added a massive, impressive demo by Moonfire called MfGames.Sdl.Demos. It shows off complex Sprite animation and Gui interaction.

3.0.0beta1
David Hudson 14 Feb 2005
* This is a big update. SDL.NET now has functionality similar to Pygame, the set of Python SDL bindings (http://pygame.org). There are some pieces missing, but SDL.NET finally has a full feature set.
* Almost all classes have changed to some extent. Please read the documentation.
* The Surface.Blit() function has changed. Instead of srcSurface.Blit(toDest, rect). It is now destSurf.Blit(fromSrcSurf, rect). This makes the method a little more intuitive when working with the main video screen. If your app window comes up blank, this change is probably the reason.
* The mixer system has been completely revamped. Each channel is now an object and can be manipulated easily.
* The event system has been revamped. The event queue can be totally controlled. There are methods for adding new events, viewing events, and removing events directly from the queue.
* Image class has been folded into Surface.
* None of singleton classes require Singleton.Instance anymore. They all use static methods so just call the methods directly.
* The CDRom subsystem now allows querying the track information of the cd.
* The joystick system has been revamped so that you can query joystick parameters directly instead of just using events. This system still needs work, it is a little sluggish.
* The video subsystem now returns much better information on the avaiable modes and the features available in the current mode and hardware.
* There are many new methods exposing various SDL functions in manay of the classes. There is too much to state here.
* I've added a major new example called "Simple Game" which shows off more of SDL.NET using a Model-View-Controller deisgn pattern. It is a reimplementation of a Pygame tutorial.
* Fixed all of the Dispose methods in all of the appropriate classes. The garbage collector was prematurely collecting certain classes.

2.2.0
David Hudson 21 Jan 2005
* Integrated smpeg into SdlDotNet
* Smpeg is used for the playing of mp3's and mpeg-1 movie files
* Note that when playing mpeg-1 files, you must close the mixer. Smpeg uses a custom
mixer. If you do not turn off the normal Mixer (Mixer.Close()) then the mpeg-1 files will play very slowly (x30 times slower).
* Added new mpeg movie player example

2.1.0
David Hudson 10 Jan 2005
* Minor cleanups to code.

2.1.0beta2
David Hudson 07 Jan 2005
* Overhauled Joystick subsystem
* Fixed JoystickButtonUp
* Separated out Joystick vertical movements from Joystick horizontal movements
* Made translating joystick movements to screen position much easier.
* Added new Joystick example
* Cleaned up a few build targets
* Started using dnpb for generating VS2003 and SharpDevelop project files.
* Fixed bug with closing handle for fonts.
* Removed build events that copy media files so that building 
is faster and creates fewer redundant files.
* Added Delegate Example back. I forgot to include the code in the last beta. Also reworked it to provide better feedback when the delegates are called.
* Workaround for problem where Music objects are disposed prematurely in Release mode.

2.1.0beta1
David Hudson 31 Dec 2004
* Added Rotation
* Added Zooming
* Added Horizontal Flipping
* Added primitive drawing (circles, ellipses, triangles)
* Fixed ChannelFinished delegate for real this time :-)
* Moved to NAnt 0.85 rc1
* Using latest version of Tao.OpenGl for the Gears example. 
The new version is much larger than ther previous versions. If 
people think it is too large to include in the release zip, let me know.
* All examples except for the CDPlayer run on Mono for Windows.

2.0.0a2:
David Hudson 3 Nov 2004
* Ran FXCop against SDL.NET and fixed a huge amount of issues that make SDL.NET more .NET "compliant".
* Decoupled Tao.Sdl and SDL.NET so that the examples do not need to reference Tao.Sdl directly.
* Made some changes to enums in Tao.Sdl that required changes in SDL.NET.

------------------------------------------
0.0.2:
Lucas Maloney - Mon 31 Mar 2003 23:48:21 EST 
 * Changed the namespace from SDL-TTFDotNet to SDLDotNet.TTF
 * Modified to use Singleton architecture.  This depends on changes to SDLDotNet which should be in version 1.4.  For now, you will have to use CVS.

0.0.1:
Lucas Maloney - Wed Mar 19 18:51:40 EST 2003
 * Initial attempt
 Lucas Maloney Sun 23 Mar 2003 21:24:41 EST 
SDLDotNet.TTF is a .NET wrapper for sdl-ttf (See http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
This is my initial import of this wrapper.  It is lacking a lot in the way of error checking and documentation, but it is fully functional.
There is a simple example program in example/.  It is based on the showfont example that comes with SDL_ttf.
