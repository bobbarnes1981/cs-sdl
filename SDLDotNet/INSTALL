To install under Windows:

From the SDL.NET download page 
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=52340),
download this file

SdlDotNet-3.1.1-1.zip

Unzip the SdlDotNet-3.1.1-1.zip file. 
Copy the files located in the /bin directory (SdlDotNet.dll and Tao.Sdl.dll)
into the Global Assembly Cache (c:\winnt\assembly).

Copy the files from /lib/win32deps into a directory in your path. 
C:\winnt or c:\winnt\system32 are common choices.

If you plan to compile SdlDotNet, you will have to run one of the scripts in the /scripts directory. There are scripts to create project files for Visual Studio 2003, Sharpdevelop and MonoDevelop.
