1 - Game Concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

100 - General
  100.1 - These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players,
    including two-player games and multiplayer games. [CompRules 2005/08/01]
  100.1a - A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.
    [CompRules 2005/08/01]
  100.1b - A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two
    players.  See Section 8, "Multiplayer Rules." [CompRules 2005/08/01]
+ 100.2 - To play, each player needs his or her own deck of traditional Magic
    cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to
    clearly track life totals. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  100.2a - In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates
    his or her own deck ahead of time), each deck must contain at least sixty
    cards.  A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and
    no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than
    basic land cards. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 100.2b - In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets a
    quantity of unopened Magic product and creates his or her own deck on the
    spot), each deck must contain at least forty cards.  A limited deck may
    contain as many duplicates of a card as a player has.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.3 - Some casual variants (either constructed or limited) require
    additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic
    cards, and dice.  See Section 9, "Casual Variants." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.4 - Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of
    additional cards the player may use to modify his or her deck between
    games of a match. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.4a - In constructed play, a sideboard (if used) must contain exactly
    fifteen cards.  The four-card limit (see Rule 100.2a) applies to the
    combined deck and sideboard. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.4b - In limited play involving individual players, all cards a player
    opens but doesn't include in his or her deck are in that player's
    sideboard. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.4c - In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant,
    all cards a team opens but doesn't include in either player's deck are in
    that team's sideboard. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.4d - In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each
    card a team opens but doesn't include in any player's deck is assigned to
    the sideboard of one of those players.  Each player has his or her own
    sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.5 - There is no maximum deck size. [CompRules 2003/10/01]
+ 100.6 - Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players
    compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered
    in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at
    <http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home>).
    These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards
    from some older sets. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.6a - Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches.  A two-player
    match usually consists of the best two of three games, or sometimes the
    best three of five.  A multiplayer match usually consists of only one
    game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 100.6b - Players can use the Magic Locator at <http://locator.wizards.com>
    to find tournaments in their area by selecting "Events" and typing in the
    name of their city. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

101 - The Magic Golden Rules
  101.1 - Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card
    takes precedence.  The card overrides only the rule that applies to that
    specific situation.  The only exception is that a player can concede the
    game at any time (see Rule 104.3a). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.2 - When a rule or effect says something can happen and another effect
    says it can't, the "can't" effect wins. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If one effect reads "You may play an additional land this turn"
    and another reads "You can't play land cards this turn," the effect that
    precludes you from playing lands wins. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.2a - Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects
    don't fall under this rule; see Rule 112.10. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.3 - Any part of an instruction that's impossible to perform is
    ignored.  (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if
    it doesn't, there's no effect.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.4 - If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the
    same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any
    choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player
    seated to the active player's left) makes any choices required, followed
    by the remaining nonactive players in turn order.  Then the actions happen
    simultaneously.  This rule is often referred to as the "Active Player,
    Nonactive Player (APNAP) order" rule. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A card reads "Each player sacrifices a creature."  First, the
    active player chooses a creature he or she controls.  Then each of the
    nonactive players chooses a creature he or she controls.  Then all
    creatures are sacrificed simultaneously. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.4a - If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such
    as his or her hand or library, those cards may remain face down as they're
    chosen.  However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card
    he or she is choosing. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.4b - A player knows the choices made by the previous players when he or
    she makes his or her choice, except as specified in Rule 101.4a.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.4c - If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the
    player makes the choices in the order written, or in the order he or she
    chooses if the choices aren't ordered. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  101.4d - If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or
    a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a
    choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

102 - Players
  102.1 - A player is one of the people in the game.  The active player is the
    player whose turn it is.  The other players are nonactive players.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  102.2 - In a two-player game, a player's opponent is the other player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  102.3 - In a multiplayer game between teams, a player's teammates are the
    other players on his or her team, and the player's opponents are all
    players not on his or her team. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

103 - Starting the Game
  103.1 - At the start of a game, each player shuffles his or her deck so that
    the cards are in a random order.  Each player may then shuffle or cut his
    or her opponents' decks.  The players' decks become their libraries.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  103.2 - After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine which one
    of them will choose who takes the first turn.  In an individual game, or
    in the first game of a match, the players may use any mutually agreeable
    method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so.  In a match of
    several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first
    turn.  If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in
    that game gets to make the choice in this game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  103.3 - Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his
    or her life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  103.3a - In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team starts with a shared life
    total of 30 instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 103.3b - In a Vanguard game, each player sets his or her life total to 20,
    as modified by the life modifier of his or her vanguard card, and draws a
    hand of seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of his or her
    vanguard card. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.3c - In an EDH game, each player sets his or her life total to 40.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.4 - A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may take a
    mulligan.  First, the starting player declares whether or not he or she
    will take a mulligan.  Then each other player in turn order does the same.
    Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take
    mulligans do so at the same time.  To take a mulligan, a player shuffles
    his or her hand back into his or her library, then draws a new hand of one
    fewer cards than he or she had before.  If a player kept his or her hand
    of cards, those cards become the player's opening hand, and that player
    may not take any further mulligans.  This process is then repeated until
    no player takes a mulligan.  (Note that if a player's hand size reaches
    zero cards, that player must keep that hand.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  103.4a - If an effect allows a player to perform an action "any time <that
    player> could mulligan," the player may perform that action at a time he
    or she would declare whether or not he or she will take a mulligan.  This
    need not be in the first round of mulligans.  Other players may have
    already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the
    option to perform this action.  If the player performs the action, he or
    she then declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 103.4b - In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he
    or she draws a new hand of as many cards as he or she had before.
    Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  103.4c - The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the multiplayer mulligan rule,
    with a slight modification.  First, each player on the starting team
    declares whether or not he or she will take a mulligan.  Then the players
    on each other team in turn order do the same.  Then all mulligans are
    taken at the same time.  A player may take a mulligan even after his or
    her teammate has decided to keep his or her opening hand.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 103.4d - The EDH casual variant uses an alternate mulligan rule.  Each time
    a player takes a mulligan, rather than shuffling his or her entire hand of
    cards into his or her library, that player exiles any number of cards from
    his or her hand.  Then the player draws a number of cards equal to one
    less than the number of cards he or she exiled this way.  Once a player
    keeps an opening hand, that player shuffles all cards he or she exiled
    this way into his or her library. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  103.5 - Once all players have kept their opening hands, if any cards in the
    starting player's hand allow that player to begin the game with those
    cards on the battlefield, he or she may put any or all of them onto the
    battlefield.  Then each other player in turn order may do the same.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 103.6 - In a Planar Magic game, the starting player moves the top card of
    his or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up.  (See
    Rule 901, "Planar Magic.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.7 - The starting player takes his or her first turn.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.7a - In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw
    step (see Rule 504, "Draw Step") of his or her first turn.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.7b - In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw
    step of their first turn. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 103.7c - In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of
    his or her first turn. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  103.Ruling.1 - The Leyline cards from Guildpact are put into the battlefield
    after players are satisfied with their hands, but before the first player
    takes his or her turn.  Each player chooses, in turn order, which Leylines
    to put into play, then they all reveal their choices simultaneously and
    put the cards into play simultaneously.  These are put into play directly
    without playing them.  They cannot be countered.  The player who will be
    going first determines the timestamp order among Leylines that start the
    game in play. [Guildpact FAQ 2005/12/22]

104 - Winning and Losing
  104.1 - A game ends immediately when a player wins or when the game is a
    draw. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.2 - There are several ways to win the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 104.2a - A player still in the game wins the game if all of that player's
    opponents have left the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  104.2b - An effect may state that a player wins the game.  (In certain
    multiplayer games, this may not cause the game to end; see Rule 104.3h.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 104.2c - In a multiplayer game between teams, a team with at least one
    player still in the game wins the game if all other teams have left the
    game.  Each player on the winning team wins the game, even if one or more
    of those players had previously lost that game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  104.3 - There are several ways to lose the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3a - A player can concede the game at any time.  A player who concedes
    leaves the game immediately.  He or she loses the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3b - If a player's life total is 0 or less, he or she loses the game the
    next time a player would receive priority.  (This is a state-based action.
    See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3c - If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in his or
    her library, he or she draws the remaining cards, and then loses the game
    the next time a player would receive priority.  (This is a state-based
    action.  See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3d - If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the
    game the next time a player would receive priority.  (This is a
    state-based action.  See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3e - An effect may state that a player loses the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3f - If a player would both win and lose simultaneously, he or she
    loses. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3g - In a multiplayer game between teams, a team loses the game if all
    players on that team have lost. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.3h - In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option,
    an effect that states that a player wins the game instead causes all of
    that player's opponents within his or her range of influence to lose the
    game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 104.3i - In an Emperor game, a team loses the game if its emperor loses the
    game.  (See Rule 807.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.3j - In an EDH game, a player that's been dealt 21 or more combat damage
    by the same general over the course of the game loses the game.  (This is
    a state-based action.  See Rule 704.  Also see Rule 903.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.3k - In a tournament game, a player can be awarded a Game Loss or a
    Match Loss by a judge.  See Rule 100.6. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  104.4 - There are several ways to draw the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.4a - If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the
    game is a draw. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.4b - If the game somehow enters a "loop" of mandatory actions, repeating
    a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw.  Loops that
    contain an optional action don't result in a draw. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  104.4c - An effect may state that the game is a draw. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 104.4d - In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw if all
    remaining teams lose simultaneously. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.4e - In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option,
    the effect of a spell or ability that states that the game is a draw
    causes the game to be a draw for that spell or ability's controller and
    all players within his or her range of influence.  Only those players
    leave the game; the game continues for all other players.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.4f - In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw for a team
    if the game is a draw for all remaining players on that team.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.4g - In the Emperor variant, the game is a draw for a team if the game
    is a draw for its emperor.  See Rule 807.5. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 104.5 - If a player loses the game, he or she leaves the game.  If the game
    is a draw for a player, he or she leaves the game.  The multiplayer rules
    handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see Rule 800.4.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

105 - Colors
  105.1 - There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red,
    and green. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.2 - An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no
    color at all.  An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its
    mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame.  See Rule 202.2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.2a - A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.2b - A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.2c - A colorless object has no color. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.3 - Effects may change an object's color or give a color to a colorless
    object.  If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces
    all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the object
    became that color "in addition" to its other colors).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  105.4 - If a player is asked to choose a color, he or she must choose one of
    the five colors.  "Multicolored" is not a color.  Neither is "colorless."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

106 - Mana
  106.1 - Mana is the primary resource in the game.  Players spend mana to pay
    costs, usually when casting spells and activating abilities.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.1a - There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.1b - There are six types of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, and
    colorless. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.2 - Mana is represented by mana symbols (see Rule 107.4).  Mana symbols
    also represent mana costs (see Rule 202). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.3 - Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see Rule 605).
    It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the
    effects of abilities that aren't mana abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 106.4 - When an effect produces mana, that mana goes into a player's mana
    pool.  From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay
    in the player's mana pool.  Each player's mana pool empties at the end of
    each step and phase. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  106.4a - If a player passes priority (see Rule 115) while there is mana in
    his or her mana pool, that player announces what mana is there.  If any
    mana remains in a player's mana pool after he or she spends mana to pay a
    cost, that player announces what mana is still there.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.5 - If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type,
    it produces no mana instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Meteor Crater has the ability "{Tap}: Choose a color of a
    permanent you control.  Add one mana of that color to your mana pool."  If
    you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Crater's mana ability
    produces no mana. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 106.6 - Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana
    can be spent, or have an additional effect that affects the spell or
    ability that mana is spent on.  This doesn't affect the mana's type.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player's mana pool contains {1}{U} which can be spent only to
    pay cumulative upkeep costs.  That player activates Doubling Cube's
    ability, which reads "{3},{Tap},Double the amount of each type of mana in
    your mana pool."  The player's mana pool now has {2}{U}{U} in it, {1}{U}
    of which can be spent on anything. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.7 - Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another
    permanent or permanents "could produce."  The type of mana a permanent
    could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of
    that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time,
    taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible
    order.  Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be
    paid.  If that permanent wouldn't produce any mana under these conditions,
    or no type of mana can be defined this way, there's no type of mana it
    could produce. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Exotic Orchard has the ability "{Tap}: Add to your mana pool
    one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls could produce."  If
    your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchard's mana ability
    will produce no mana.  The same is true if you and your opponent each
    control no lands other than Exotic Orchards.  However, if you control a
    Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic
    Orchard, then each Exotic Orchard could produce {G}.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.8 - If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a
    player's mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol.  If a
    colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that player's
    mana pool.  If a colorless half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana
    represented by that half's number is added to that player's mana pool.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  106.9 - To "tap a permanent for mana" is to activate a mana ability of that
    permanent that includes the {Tap} symbol in its activation cost.  See
    Rule 605, "Mana Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

107 - Numbers and Symbols
  107.1 - The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.1a - You can't choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain
    fractional life, and so on.  If a spell or ability could generate a
    fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up
    or down. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.1b - Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and
    zero.  You can't choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain
    negative life, and so on.  However, it's possible for a game value, such
    as a creature's power, to be less than zero.  If a calculation or
    comparison that would determine the result of an effect needs to use a
    negative value, it does so.  If such a calculation yields a negative
    number, zero is used instead, unless that effect sets a player's life
    total to a specific value, sets a creature's power or toughness to a
    specific value, or otherwise modifies a creature's power or toughness.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it's a -2/4 creature.  It assigns 0
    damage in combat.  Its total power and toughness is 2.  You'd have to give
    it +3/+0 to raise its power to 1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature that says "{Tap}: Add an
    amount of {G} to your mana pool equal to Viridian Joiner's power."  An
    effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated.  The ability adds no
    mana to your mana pool. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.2 - If anything needs to use a number that can't be determined, either
    as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.3 - Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that
    needs to be determined.  Some objects have abilities that define the value
    of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 107.3a - If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost,
    additional cost, and/or activation cost with an {X}, <-X>, or X in it, and
    the value of X isn't defined by the text of that spell or ability, the
    controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X
    as part of casting the spell or activating the ability.  (See
    Rule 601, "Casting Spells.")  While a spell is on the stack, any X in its
    mana cost equals the announced value.  While an activated ability is on
    the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  107.3b - If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost,
    the value of X isn't defined by the text of that spell, and an effect lets
    that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an
    alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0.
    This doesn't apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce
    it to zero.  See Rule 601, "Casting Spells." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 107.3c - If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, <-X>, or X in its cost
    and/or its text, and the value of X is defined by the text of that spell
    or ability, then that's the value of X while that spell or ability is on
    the stack.  The controller of that spell or ability doesn't get to choose
    the value.  Note that the value of X may change while that spell or
    ability is on the stack. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  107.3d - If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost
    or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X in it, the value of X is chosen by the
    player taking the special action as he or she pays that cost.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.3e - Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a
    mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost.  If the
    value of X isn't defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses
    the value of X at the appropriate time (either as it's put on the stack or
    as it resolves). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.3f - If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana
    cost, the value of {X} is treated as 0, even if the value of X is defined
    somewhere within its text. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.3g - All instances of X on an object have the same value at any given
    time. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.3h - Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X.  Y
    follows the same rules as X. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4 - The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {X}; the numerals
    {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B},
    {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; the
    monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, and {2/G}; and the
    snow symbol {S}. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4a - There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white, {U}
    blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green.  These symbols are used to
    represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs.
    Colored mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana.
    See Rule 202, "Mana Cost and Color." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4b - Numeral symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X})
    represent generic mana in costs.  Generic mana in costs can be paid with
    any type of mana.  For more information about {X}, see Rule 107.3.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4c - Numeral symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X})
    can also represent colorless mana if they appear in the effect of a spell
    or ability that reads "add <mana symbol> to your mana pool" or something
    similar.  (See Rule 107.3e.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4d - The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder
    for a cost that can be paid with no resources.  (See Rule 116.5.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 107.4e - Hybrid mana symbols are also colored mana symbols.  Each one
    represents a cost that can be paid in one of two ways, as represented by
    the two halves of the symbol.  A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid
    with either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as
    {2/B} can be paid with either one black mana or two mana of any type.  A
    hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: {G/W}{G/W} can be paid by spending {G}{G}, {G}{W}, or {W}{W}.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.4f - The snow mana symbol {S} represents one generic mana in a cost.
    This generic mana can be paid with one mana of any type produced by a snow
    permanent (see Rule 204.4f).  Effects that reduce the amount of generic
    mana you pay don't affect {S} costs.  (There is no such thing as "snow
    mana"; "snow" is not a type of mana.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.5 - The tap symbol is {Tap}.  The tap symbol in an activation cost
    means "Tap this permanent."  A permanent that's already tapped can't be
    tapped again to pay the cost.  A creature's activated ability with the tap
    symbol in its activation cost can't be activated unless the creature has
    been under its controller's control continuously since his or her most
    recent turn began.  See Rule 302.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.6 - The untap symbol is {Untap}.  The untap symbol in an activation cost
    means "Untap this permanent."  A permanent that's already untapped can't
    be untapped again to pay the cost.  A creature's activated ability with
    the untap symbol in its activation cost can't be activated unless the
    creature has been under its controller's control continuously since his or
    her most recent turn began.  See Rule 302.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.7 - Each activated ability of a planeswalker has an arrow-shaped loyalty
    symbol in its cost.  Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a
    plus sign followed by a number or an X.  Negative loyalty symbols point
    downward and feature a minus sign followed by a number or an X.  <+N>
    means "Put N loyalty counters on this permanent," and <-N> means "Remove N
    loyalty counters from this permanent." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.8 - A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odyssey
    block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player's graveyard.  The
    purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they're in a
    graveyard.  This icon has no effect on game play. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  107.9 - A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the
    Future Sight set printed with an alternate "timeshifted" frame.  If the
    card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks
    for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise
    for enchantment, a chalice for artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for
    land.  If the card has multiple card types, that's indicated by a black
    and white cross.  This icon has no effect on game play.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 107.10 - The planeswalker symbol is {P}.  It appears on one face of the
    planar die used in the Planar Magic casual variant.  See Rule 901, "Planar
    Magic." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 107.11 - The chaos symbol is {C}.  It appears on one face of the planar die
    used in the Planar Magic casual variant, as well as in triggered abilities
    that refer to the results of rolling the planar die.  See
    Rule 901, "Planar Magic." [CompRules 2009/10/01]

108 - Cards
  108.1 - Use the Oracle card reference when determining a card's wording.  A
    card's Oracle text can be found using the Gatherer card database at
    <http://gatherer.wizards.com>. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 108.2 - When a rule or text on a card refers to a "card," it means a Magic
    card with a Magic card front and the Magic card back.  This includes both
    traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm)
    by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm) and have a "Deckmaster" back, and nontraditional
    Magic cards, which are oversized and have different backs.  Tokens aren't
    considered cards--even a card that represents a token isn't considered a
    card for rules purposes. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  108.2a - In the text of spells or abilities, the term "card" is used only to
    refer to a card that's not on the battlefield or on the stack, such as a
    creature card in a player's hand.  For more information, see
    Section 4, "Zones." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 108.3 - A card's owner is the player who started the game with it in his or
    her deck.  If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather
    than starting in a player's deck, its owner is the player who brought it
    into the game.  If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner
    is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the
    game.  (Legal ownership of a card is irrelevant to the game rules except
    for the rules for ante; see Rule 407.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 108.3a - In a Planar Magic game using the single planar deck option, the
    planar controller is considered to be the owner of all the plane cards.
    See Rule 901.6. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  108.4 - A card doesn't have a controller unless that card represents a
    permanent or spell; in those cases, its controller is determined by the
    rules for permanents or spells.  See Rule 110.2 and Rule 111.2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  108.4a - If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesn't have
    one (because it's not a permanent or spell), use its owner instead.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 108.5 - Nontraditional Magic cards can't start the game in any zone other
    than the command zone (see Rule 408).  If an effect would bring a
    nontraditional Magic card into the game from outside the game, it doesn't;
    that card remains outside the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 108.6 - For more information about cards, see Section 2, "Parts of a Card."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

109 - Objects
  109.1 - An object is an ability on the stack, a card, a copy of a card, a
    token, a spell, or a permanent. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  109.2 - If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes
    a card type or subtype, but doesn't include the word "card," "spell,"
    or "source," it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the
    battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  109.2a - If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes
    the word "card" and the name of a zone, it means a card matching that
    description in the stated zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  109.2b - If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes
    the word "spell," it means a spell matching that description on the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  109.2c - If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes
    the word "source," it means a source matching that description--either a
    source of an ability or a source of damage--in any zone.  See Rule 609.7.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 109.3 - An object's characteristics are name, mana cost, color, card type,
    subtype, supertype, expansion symbol, rules text, abilities, power,
    toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier.  Objects can have
    some or all of these characteristics.  Any other information about an
    object isn't a characteristic.  For example, characteristics don't include
    whether a permanent is tapped, a spell's target, an object's owner or
    controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 109.4 - Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller.
    Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield aren't
    controlled by any player.  See Rule 108.4.  There are two exceptions to
    this rule: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 109.4a - In a Planar Magic game, a face-up plane card is controlled by the
    player designated as the planar controller.  This is usually the active
    player. See Rule 901.6. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 109.4b - In a Vanguard game, each vanguard card is controlled by its owner.
    See Rule 902.6. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  109.5 - The words "you" and "your" on an object refer to the object's
    controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to cast or
    activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller).  For a static
    ability, this is the current controller of the object it's on.  For an
    activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability.  For a
    triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability
    triggered, unless it's a delayed triggered ability.  For a delayed
    triggered ability, this is the controller of the spell or ability that
    created it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

110 - Permanents
  110.1 - A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield.  A permanent
    remains on the battlefield indefinitely.  A card or token becomes a
    permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as
    it's moved to another zone by an effect or rule. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.2 - A permanent's owner is the same as the owner of the card that
    represents it (unless it's a token; see Rule 110.5a).  A permanent's
    controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the
    battlefield.  Every permanent has a controller. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.2a - If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the
    battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player's
    control unless the effect states otherwise. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.3 - A nontoken permanent's characteristics are the same as those printed
    on its card, as modified by any continuous effects.  See
    Rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.4 - There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment,
    land, and planeswalker.  Instant and sorcery cards can't enter the
    battlefield and thus can't be permanents.  Some tribal cards can enter the
    battlefield and some can't, depending on their other card types.  See
    Section 3, "Card Types." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.4a - The term "permanent card" is used to refer to a card that could be
    put onto the battlefield.  Specifically, it means an artifact, creature,
    enchantment, land, or planeswalker card. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.4b - The term "permanent spell" is used to refer to a spell that will
    enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution.
    Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker
    spell. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.4c - If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on
    the battlefield.  It's still a permanent. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5 - Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield.  A token is a marker
    used to represent any permanent that isn't represented by a card.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5a - A token is both owned and controlled by the player under whose
    control it entered the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5b - The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of
    any number of characteristics for the token.  This becomes the
    token's "text."  The characteristic values defined this way are
    functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a
    card; for example, they define the token's copiable values.  A token
    doesn't have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that
    created it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Sprout is an instant that says "Put a 1/1 green Saproling
    creature token onto the battlefield."  The resulting token has no mana
    cost, supertype, expansion symbol, rules text, or abilities.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5c - A spell or ability that creates a creature token sets both its name
    and its creature type.  If the spell or ability doesn't specify the name
    of the creature token, its name is the same as its creature type(s).
    A "Goblin Scout creature token," for example, is named "Goblin Scout" and
    has the creature subtypes Goblin and Scout.  Once a token is on the
    battlefield, changing its name doesn't change its creature type, and vice
    versa. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5d - A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general
    or that affects the token's card type or subtype.  A token isn't a
    card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came
    from a Magic booster pack). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5e - A token that's phased out, or that's in a zone other than the
    battlefield, ceases to exist.  This is a state-based action; see
    Rule 704.  (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered
    abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.5f - A token that has left the battlefield can't come back onto the
    battlefield.  If such a token would return to the battlefield, it remains
    in its current zone instead.  It ceases to exist the next time state-based
    actions are checked; see Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.6 - A permanent's status is its physical state.  There are four status
    categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped,
    flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out.  Each
    permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.6a - Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent's
    characteristics. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  110.6b - Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and
    phased in unless a spell or ability says otherwise. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 110.6c - A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or
    turn-based action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Dimir Doppelganger says "{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card
    from a graveyard.  Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and
    gains this ability."  It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip
    card.  Through use of Jushi Apprentice's ability, this creature flips,
    making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with the Dimir Doppelganger
    ability.  If this permanent then becomes a copy of Ruleclaw Bear, it
    will retain its flipped status even though that has no relevance to
    Runeclaw Bear.  If its copy ability is activated again, this time
    targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent's
    flipped status means it will have the characteristics of
    Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with
    the Dimir Doppelganger ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  110.6d - Only permanents have status.  Cards not on the battlefield do not.
    Although an exiled card may be face down, this has no correlation to the
    face-down status of a permanent.  Similarly, cards not on the battlefield
    are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

111 - Spells
  111.1 - A spell is a card on the stack.  As the first step of being
    cast (see Rule 601, "Casting Spells"), the card becomes a spell and is
    moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually
    its owner's hand.  (See Rule 405, "Stack.")  A spell remains on the stack
    as a spell until it resolves (see Rule 608, "Resolving Spells and
    Abilities"), is countered (see Rule 701.5), or otherwise leaves the stack.
    For more information, see Section 6, "Spells, Abilities, and Effects."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  111.1a - A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card
    associated with it.  See Rule 706.9. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  111.1b - Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player
    does, that copy is a spell as well.  See Rule 706.11.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  111.2 - A spell's owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents
    it, unless it's a copy.  In that case, the owner of the spell is the
    player under whose control it was put on the stack.  A spell's controller
    is, by default, the player under whose control it was put on the
    stack.  (For noncopy spells, that's the player who cast it.)  Every spell
    has a controller. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  111.3 - A noncopy spell's characteristics are the same as those printed on
    its card, as modified by any continuous effects.  See
    Rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  111.4 - If an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the
    effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves.  See
    Rule 400.7. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the
    creature is white when it enters the battlefield and remains white for the
    duration of the effect changing its color. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

112 - Abilities
  112.1 - An ability can be one of two things: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.1a - An ability is a characteristic an object has that lets it affect
    the game.  An object's abilities are defined by its rules text or by the
    effect that created it.  Abilities can also be granted to objects by rules
    or effects.  (Effects that do so use the words "has," "have," "gains,"
    or "gain.")  Abilities generate effects.  (See Rule 609, "Effects.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.1b - An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack.
    This kind of ability is an object.  (See Section 6, "Spells, Abilities,
    and Effects.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.2 - Abilities can affect the objects they're on.  They can also affect
    other objects and/or players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.2a - Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: "<This creature> can't block" is an ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.2b - An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability
    of the card. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 112.2c - An object may have multiple abilities.  If the object is
    represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may
    be strung together on a single line (see Rule 702, "Keyword Abilities"),
    each paragraph break in a card's text marks a separate ability.  If the
    object is not represented by a card, the effect that created it may have
    given it multiple abilities.  An object may also be granted additional
    abilities by a spell or ability.  If an object has multiple instances of
    the same ability, each instance functions independently.  This may or may
    not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific
    ability for more information. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  112.2d - Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects.
    Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects.
    See Rule 609, "Effects." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.3 - There are four general categories of abilities:
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.3a - Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions
    while an instant or sorcery spell is resolving.  Any text on an instant or
    sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it's an activated ability, a
    triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in
    Rules 112.5a through Rule 112.5j. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.3b - Activated abilities have a cost and an effect.  They are written
    as "<Cost>: <Effect.> <Activation restriction (if any).>"  A player may
    activate such an ability whenever he or she has priority.  Doing so puts
    it on the stack, where it remains until it's countered, it resolves, or it
    otherwise leaves the stack.  See Rule 602, "Activating Activated
    Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.3c - Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect.  They
    are written as "<Trigger condition>, <effect>," and begin with the
    word "when," "whenever," or "at."  Whenever the trigger event occurs, the
    ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority
    and stays there until it's countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves
    the stack.  See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.3d - Static abilities are written as statements.  They're simply true.
    Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the
    permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or
    while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone.  See
    Rule 604, "Handling Static Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  112.4 - Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana
    abilities.  Mana abilities follow special rules: They don't use the stack,
    and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities
    even if he or she doesn't have priority.  See Rule 605, "Mana Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 112.5 - Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities.  Loyalty abilities
    follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a
    permanent he or she controls any time he or she has priority and the stack
    is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if none of that
    permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated that turn.  See
    Rule 606, "Loyalty Abilities." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6 - Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while
    that object is on the stack.  Abilities of all other objects usually
    function only while that object is on the battlefield.  The exceptions are
    as follows: [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6a - Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside
    the game.  (See Rule 604.3.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6b - An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only
    from those zones. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6c - An object's ability that modifies what that particular object costs
    to cast functions on the stack. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6d - An object's ability that restricts or modifies how that particular
    object can be played or cast functions in any zone from which it could be
    played or cast. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6e - An object's ability that restricts or modifies what zones that
    particular object can be played or cast from functions in all zones.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6f - An object's ability that modifies how that particular object enters
    the battlefield functions as that object is entering the battlefield.  See
    Rule 613.12. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6g - An object's activated ability that has a cost that can't be paid
    while the object is on the battlefield functions from any zone in which
    its cost can be paid. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6h - A trigger condition that can't trigger from the battlefield
    functions in all zones it can trigger from.  Other trigger conditions of
    the same triggered ability may function in different zones.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Absolver Thrull has the ability "When Absolver Thrull enters
    the battlefield or the creature it haunts is put into a graveyard, destroy
    target enchantment."  The first trigger condition triggers from the
    battlefield and the second trigger condition functions from the exile
    zone.  (See Rule 702.52, "Haunt.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 112.6i - An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object
    it's on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless that
    ability's trigger condition, or a previous part of that ability's cost or
    effect, specifies that the object is put into that zone.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Necrosavant says "{3}{B}{B}, Sacrifice a creature: Return
    Necrosavant from your graveyard to the battlefield.  Activate this ability
    only during your upkeep."  A player may activate this ability only if
    Necrosavant is in his or her graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 112.6j - An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions
    before the game begins.  Such an ability modifies not just the
    Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules
    and any other documents that set the deck construction rules for a
    specific Constructed format.  However, such an ability can't affect the
    format legality of a card, including whether it's banned or restricted.
    The current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at
    <http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home>.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.6k - Abilities of plane cards and vanguard cards function in the command
    zone.  See Rule 901, "Planar Magic," and Rule 902, "Vanguard."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.7 - The source of an ability on the stack is the object that generated
    that ability.  For an activated ability, it's the object whose ability was
    activated.  For a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered
    ability), it's the object whose ability triggered.  For a delayed
    triggered ability created by another ability, it's the source of that
    other ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.7a - Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack
    independently of its source.  Destruction or removal of the source after
    that time won't affect the ability.  Note that some abilities cause a
    source to do something (for example, "Prodigal Sorcerer deals 1 damage
    to target creature or player") rather than the ability doing anything
    directly.  In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that
    references information about the source because the effect needs to be
    divided checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack.
    Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves.  In both
    instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it's expected to be in
    at that time, its last known information is used.  The source can still
    perform the action even though it no longer exists. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.8 - The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player
    who activated it.  The controller of a triggered ability on the
    stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who
    controlled the ability's source when it triggered, or, if it had no
    controller, the player who owned the ability's source when it triggered.
    The controller of a delayed triggered ability on the stack is the player
    who controlled the spell or ability that created it.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.9 - Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren't spells, and
    therefore can't be countered by anything that counters only spells.
    Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects
    that specifically counter abilities, as well as by the rules (for example,
    an ability with one or more targets is countered if all its targets become
    illegal).  Static abilities don't use the stack and thus can't be
    countered at all. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.10 - Effects can add or remove abilities of objects.  An effect that
    adds an ability will state that the object "gains" or "has" that ability.
    An effect that removes an ability will state that the object "loses" that
    ability.  Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.  If
    two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most
    recent one prevails.  (See Rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects.")
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 112.11 - An effect that sets an object's characteristic, or simply states a
    quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect.
    When an object "gains" or "has" an ability, that ability can be removed by
    another effect.  If an effect defines a characteristic of the
    object ("<permanent> is <characteristic value>"), it's not granting an
    ability.  (See Rule 604.3.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, "Creatures with no abilities
    get +2/+2."  A Runeclaw Bear (a creature with no abilities) enchanted
    by an Aura that says "Enchanted creature has flying" would not get +2/+2.
    A Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says "Enchanted creature is red"
    or "Enchanted creature is indestructible" would get +2/+2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

113 - Targets
  113.1 - Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or
    more targets for them.  The targets are object(s), player(s), and/or
    zone(s) the spell or ability will affect.  These targets are declared as
    part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack.  The
    targets can't be changed except by another spell or ability that
    explicitly says it can do so. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.1a - An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability
    identifies something it will affect by using the phrase "target
    <something>," where the "something" is a phrase that describes an object,
    player, or zone.  The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see
    Rule 601.2c.  (If an activated or triggered ability of an instant or
    sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is
    not.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A sorcery card has the ability "When you cycle this card, target
    creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn."  This triggered ability is
    targeted, but that doesn't make the card it's on targeted.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.1b - Aura spells are always targeted.  These are the only permanent
    spells with targets.  An Aura's target is specified by its enchant keyword
    ability (see Rule 702.5, "Enchant").  The target(s) are chosen as the
    spell is cast; see Rule 601.2c.  An Aura permanent doesn't target
    anything; only the spell is targeted.  (An activated or triggered ability
    of an Aura permanent can also be targeted.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.1c - An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will
    affect by using the phrase "target <something>," where the "something" is
    a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone.  The target(s) are
    chosen as the ability is activated; see Rule 602.2b.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.1d - A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will
    affect by using the phrase "target <something>," where the "something" is
    a phrase that describes an object, player, or zone.  The target(s) are
    chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see Rule 603.3d.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.1e - Some keyword abilities, such as equip and provoke, represent
    targeted activated or triggered abilities.  In those cases, the
    phrase "target <something>" appears in the rule for that keyword ability
    rather than in the ability itself.  (The keyword's reminder text will
    often contain the word "target.")  See Rule 702, "Keyword Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 113.2 - Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a
    spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another
    zone or a player, (b) targets an object that can't exist on the
    battlefield, such as a spell or ability, or (c) targets a zone.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  113.3 - The same target can't be chosen multiple times for any one instance
    of the word "target" on a spell or ability.  If the spell or ability uses
    the word "target" in multiple places, the same object, player, or zone can
    be chosen once for each instance of the word "target" (as long as it fits
    the targeting criteria). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.4 - A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.5 - Spells and abilities that can have zero or more targets are targeted
    only if one or more targets have been chosen for them.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.6 - Some effects allow a player to change the target of a spell or
    ability.  If so, the target can be changed only to another legal target.
    If the target can't be changed to another legal target, the original
    target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by
    then. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.6a - Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting
    requirements for each mode.  An effect that allows a player to change the
    target of a modal spell or ability doesn't allow that player to change its
    mode.  (See Rule 700.2.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.7 - Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting.
    Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the
    targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.7a - An object that looks for a "<spell or ability> that targets
    <something>" checks the current state of that spell or ability's targets.
    If an object it targets is still in the zone it's expected to be in or a
    player it targets is still in the game, that target's current information
    is used, even if it's not currently legal for that spell or ability.  If
    an object it targets is no longer in the zone it's expected to be in or a
    player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its
    last known information is not used. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.7b - An object that looks for a "<spell or ability> with a single
    target" checks the number of times any objects, players, or zones became
    the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the
    number of its targets that are currently legal.  If the same object,
    player, or zone became a target more than once, each of those instances is
    counted separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.7c - An object that looks for a "<spell or ability> that targets only
    <something>" checks the number of different objects or players that became
    the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack (as
    modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those
    objects or players that are currently legal targets.  If that number is
    one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player multiple
    times), the current state of that spell or ability's target is checked as
    described in Rule 113.7a. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.9 - Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don't
    target.  In general, those objects and players aren't chosen until the
    spell or ability resolves.  See Rule 608, "Resolving Spells and
    Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.9a - Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or
    ability doesn't make that object or player a target of that spell or
    ability.  Unless that object or player is identified by the word "target"
    in the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword
    ability, it is not a target. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  113.9b - In particular, the word "you" in an object's text doesn't indicate
    a target. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

114 - Special Actions
  114.1 - Special actions are actions a player may take when he or she has
    priority that don't use the stack.  These are not to be confused with
    turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates
    automatically.  (See Rule 703, "Turn-Based Actions," and
    Rule 704, "State-Based Actions.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 114.2 - There are six special actions: [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  114.2a - Playing a land is a special action.  To play a land, a player puts
    that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that
    player's hand).  A player can take this action any time he or she has
    priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn,
    but only if he or she hasn't yet played a land that turn.  See
    Rule 305, "Lands." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  114.2b - Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action.  A player
    can take this action any time he or she has priority.  See
    Rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  114.2c - Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time,
    usually to end a continuous effect or to stop a delayed triggered ability
    from triggering.  Doing so is a special action.  A player can take such an
    action any time he or she has priority, but only if the ability or effect
    allows it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  114.2d - Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action
    to ignore the effect from that ability for a duration.  Doing so is a
    special action.  A player can take such an action any time he or she has
    priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  114.2e - A player who has a card with suspend in his or her hand may exile
    that card.  This is a special action.  A player can take this action any
    time he or she has priority, but only if he or she could begin to cast
    that card by putting it onto the stack.  See Rule 702.59, "Suspend."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 114.2f - In a Planar Magic game, rolling the planar die is a special action.
    A player can take this action any time he or she has priority and the
    stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn.  Taking this action
    costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times he or she
    has previously taken this action on that turn.  See Rule 901, "Planar
    Magic." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  114.3 - If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority
    afterward. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

115 - Timing and Priority
+ 115.1 - Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action,
    which player can take actions at any given time is determined by a system
    of priority.  The player with priority may cast spells, activate
    abilities, and take special actions. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  115.1a - A player may cast an instant spell any time he or she has priority.
    A player may cast a noninstant spell during his or her main phase any time
    he or she has priority and the stack is empty. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.1b - A player may activate an activated ability any time he or she has
    priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.1c - A player may take some special actions any time he or she has
    priority.  A player may take other special actions during his or her main
    phase any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty.  See
    Rule 114, "Special Actions." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.1d - A player may activate a mana ability whenever he or she has
    priority, whenever he or she is casting a spell or activating an ability
    that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana
    payment (even in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating
    or resolving an ability). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 115.2 - Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or
    performed by the game rules, or are performed by players without receiving
    priority. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  115.2a - Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a
    spell is being cast, an ability is being activated, or a spell or ability
    is resolving.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")  However,
    nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers.  Each time a
    player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered but hasn't
    yet been put on the stack is put on the stack.  See Rule 115.5.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.2b - Static abilities continuously affect the game.  Priority doesn't
    apply to them.  (See Rule 604, "Handling Static Abilities," and
    Rule 611, "Continuous Effects.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.2c - Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or
    phases begin.  They're dealt with before a player would receive priority.
    See Rule 115.3a.  Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each
    step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward.  See
    Rule 703, "Turn-Based Actions." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.2d - State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions
    are met.  See Rule 704.  They're dealt with before a player would receive
    priority.  See Rule 115.5. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 115.2e - Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices
    or take actions, or may allow players to activate mana abilities.  Even if
    a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or ability is
    resolving.  See Rule 608, "Resolving Spells and Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  115.3 - Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.3a - The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps
    and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during
    the draw step; see Rule 703) have been dealt with and abilities that
    trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack.
    No player receives priority during the untap step.  Players usually don't
    get priority during the cleanup step (see Rule 514.3).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.3b - The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other
    than a mana ability) resolves. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.3c - If a player has priority when he or she casts a spell, activates an
    ability, or takes a special action, that player receives priority
    afterward. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.3d - If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that
    player passes.  If any mana is in that player's mana pool, he or she
    announces what mana is there.  Then the next player in turn order receives
    priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.4 - If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass
    without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on
    top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step
    ends. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.5 - Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all
    applicable state-based actions as a single event (see
    Rule 704, "State-Based Actions"), then repeats this process until no
    state-based actions are performed.  Then triggered abilities are put on
    the stack (see Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities").  These steps
    repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no
    abilities trigger.  Then the player who would have received priority does
    so. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  115.6 - In the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, teams rather than
    individual players have priority.  See Rule 806, "Two-Headed Giant
    Variant." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 115.7 - If a player with priority casts an spell or activates an activated
    ability while another spell or ability is already on the stack, the new
    spell or ability has been cast or activated "in response to" the earlier
    spell or ability.  The new spell or ability will resolve first. See
    Rule 608, "Resolving Spells and Abilities." [CompRules 2009/10/01]

116 - Costs
  116.1 - A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or
    to stop another action from taking place.  To pay a cost, a player carries
    out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that
    contains that cost. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.2 - If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a
    chance to activate mana abilities.  Paying the cost to cast a spell or
    activate an activated ability follows the steps in Rule 601.2e through
    Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.3 - A player can't pay a cost unless he or she has the necessary
    resources to pay it fully.  For example, a player with only 1 life can't
    pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that's already tapped can't be
    tapped to pay a cost.  See Rule 202, "Mana Cost and Color," and
    Rule 602, "Activating Activated Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.3a - Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player's
    mana pool.  (Players can always pay 0 mana.)  If excess mana remains in
    that player's mana pool after making that payment, the player announces
    what mana is still there. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.3b - Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life
    from a player's life total.  (Players can always pay 0 life.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.4 - Some costs include an {X} or an X.  See Rule 107.3.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.5 - Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}.  The
    action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player's
    acknowledgment that he or she is paying it.  Even though such a cost
    requires no resources, it is not automatically paid.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.5a - A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as
    one with a cost greater than zero; it won't cast itself automatically.
    The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.6 - Some mana costs contain no mana symbols.  This represents an
    unpayable cost.  An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is
    based on the mana cost of a spell with no mana cost.  Attempting to cast a
    spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action.
    However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.6a - If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional
    cost is imposed, the cost is still unpayable.  If an alternative cost is
    applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to
    cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be
    paid. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 116.7 - What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or
    reduced by effects.  If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing
    by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}.  Paying a cost
    changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.7a - If a cost would be reduced by an amount of mana represented by a
    hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that cost chooses one half of that
    symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see Rule 601.2e).  If a
    colored half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color (or,
    if the cost can't be reduced by one mana of that color, the cost is
    reduced by one generic mana).  If a colorless half is chosen, the cost is
    reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half's number.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.8 - Some spells and abilities have additional costs.  An additional cost
    is a cost listed in a spell's rules text, or applied to a spell or ability
    from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time that
    player pays the spell's mana cost or the ability's activation cost.  A
    cost is an additional cost only if it is phrased using the
    word "additional."  Note that some additional costs are listed in
    keywords; see Rule 702. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.8a - Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it's
    being cast or to an ability as it's being activated.  The controller of
    the spell or ability announces his or her intentions to pay any or all of
    those costs as described in Rule 601.2b. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.8b - Some additional costs are optional. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.8c - Additional costs don't change a spell's mana cost, only what its
    controller has to pay to cast it.  Spells and abilities that ask for that
    spell's mana cost still see the original value. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.8d - Some effects increase the cost to cast a spell or activate an
    ability without using the word "additional."  Those are not additional
    costs, and are not considered until determining the total cost of a spell
    or ability as described in Rule 601.2e. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.9 - Some spells have alternative costs.  An alternative cost is a cost
    listed in a spell's text, or applied to it from another effect, that its
    controller may pay rather than paying the spell's mana cost.  Alternative
    costs are usually phrased, "You may <action> rather than pay <this
    object's> mana cost," or "You may cast <this object> without paying its
    mana cost."  Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see
    Rule 702. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 116.9a - Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it's
    being cast.  The controller of the spell announces his or her intentions
    to pay that cost as described in Rule 601.2b. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  116.9b - Alternative costs are always optional. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.9c - An alternative cost doesn't change a spell's mana cost, only what
    its controller has to pay to cast it.  Spells and abilities that ask for
    that spell's mana cost still see the original value.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.9d - If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any
    additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that
    spell are applied to that alternative cost.  (See Rule 601.2e.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.10 - Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or
    effect.  For example, a player can't sacrifice just one creature to
    activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require
    sacrificing a creature as a cost.  Also, the resolution of a spell or
    ability doesn't pay another spell or ability's cost, even if part of its
    effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.11 - The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by
    effects.  Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don't
    match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a
    cumulative upkeep cost of "Draw a card," and Obstinate Familiar, a
    creature that says "If you would draw a card, you may skip that draw
    instead."  The player may decide to pay Psychic Vortex's cumulative upkeep
    cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the appropriate amount.
    The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 116.12 - Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities
    read, "<Do something>.  If <a player> <does or doesn't>, <effect>." or "<A
    player> may <do something>.  If <that player> <does or doesn't>,
    <effect>."  The action <do something> is a cost, paid when the spell or
    ability resolves.  The "If <a player> <does or doesn't>" clause checks
    whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a
    mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You control Hesitation, an enchantment that says "When a
    player casts a spell, sacrifice Hesitation.  If you do, counter that
    spell."  A spell is cast, causing Hesitation's ability to trigger.  Then
    an ability is played that exiles Hesitation.  When Hesitation's ability
    resolves, you're unable to pay the "sacrifice Hesitation" cost.  The spell
    is not countered. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says "If
    a creature would enter the battlefield under an opponent's control this
    turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead."  You control
    a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says "When
    Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may put a creature card with morph from
    your hand onto the battlefield face up.  If you do, return Dermoplasm to
    its owner's hand."  You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a
    creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield.  Due to
    Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponent's control
    instead of yours.  However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is
    still returned to its owner's hand. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  116.12a - Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities
    read, "<Do something> unless you <do something else>."  This means the
    same thing as "You may <do something else>.  If you don't, <do
    something>." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

117 - Life
+ 117.1 - Each player begins the game with a life total of 20.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 117.1a - In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team begins the game with a shared
    life total of 30 instead; see Rule 806, "Two-Headed Giant Variant."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 117.1b - In a Vanguard game, each player begins the game with a starting
    life total of 20, as modified by his or her vanguard card's life modifier.
    See Rule 902, "Vanguard." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 117.1c - In an EDH game, each player begins the game with a starting life
    total of 40 instead; see Rule 903, "EDH." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  117.2 - Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.3 - If an effect causes a player to gain life or lose life, that
    player's life total is adjusted accordingly. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.4 - If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater
    than 0, the player may do so only if his or her life total is greater than
    or equal to the amount of the payment.  If a player pays life, the payment
    is subtracted from his or her life total.  (Players can always pay 0
    life.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.4a - If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life
    greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant game, the player may do so only if
    his or her team's life total is greater than or equal to the total amount
    of life both team members are paying for that cost or effect.  If a player
    pays life, the payment is subtracted from his or her team's life
    total.  (Players can always pay 0 life.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.5 - If an effect sets a player's life total to a specific number, the
    player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new
    total. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.6 - If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a
    state-based action.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  117.7 - If an effect says that a player can't gain life, that player can't
    exchange life totals with a player who has a higher life total; in that
    case, the exchange won't happen.  In addition, a cost that involves having
    that player gain life can't be paid, and a replacement effect that would
    replace a life gain event affecting that player won't do anything.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

118 - Damage
+ 118.1 - Objects can deal damage to creatures, planeswalkers, and players.
    This is generally detrimental to the object or player that receives that
    damage.  An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  118.1a - Damage can't be dealt to an object that's neither a creature nor a
    planeswalker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.2 - Any object can deal damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.2a - Damage may be dealt as a result of combat.  Each attacking and
    blocking creature deals combat damage equal to its power during the combat
    damage step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.2b - Damage may be dealt as an effect of a spell or ability.  The spell
    or ability will specify which object deals that damage.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 118.3 - Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on
    whether the recipient of the damage is a player or permanent, the
    characteristics of the damage's source, and the characteristics of the
    damage's recipient (if it's a permanent). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  118.3a - Damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.3b - Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to
    be removed from that planeswalker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.3c - Damage dealt to a creature by a source with wither causes that
    many -1/-1 counters to be put on that creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.3d - Damage dealt to a creature by a source without wither causes that
    much damage to be marked on that creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.3e - Damage dealt to an object or player by a source with lifelink
    causes that source's controller to gain that much life, in addition to the
    damage's other results. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.4 - Damage is processed in a three-part sequence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.4a - First, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention
    effects that interact with damage.  (See Rule 614, "Replacement Effects,"
    and Rule 615, "Prevention Effects.")  Abilities that trigger when damage
    is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.4b - Next, damage that's been dealt is transformed into its results, as
    modified by replacement effects that interact with those results (such as
    life loss or counters). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.4c - Finally, the damage event occurs. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that
    says "If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,"
    attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink.  It's blocked by
    a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the
    next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature.  The damage
    event starts out as "3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is
    dealt to the 3/3 creature".  The prevention effect is applied, so the
    damage event becomes "1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is
    dealt to the 3/3 creature".  That's transformed into its results, so the
    damage event is now "one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the
    active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature".  Boon
    Reflection's effect is applied, so the damage event becomes "one -1/-1
    counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2
    damage is marked on the 3/3 creature".  Then the damage event occurs.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an
    enchantment that says "If you control a creature, damage that would reduce
    your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead."  That player is
    at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures.  The
    player casts Awe Strike, which says "The next time target creature
    would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage.  You gain life equal to
    the damage prevented this way," targeting one of the attackers.  The
    damage event starts out as "10 damage is dealt to the defending player".
    Awe Strike's effect is applied, so the damage event becomes "5 damage is
    dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life".  That's
    transformed into its results, so the damage event is now "the defending
    player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life".  Worship's effect
    sees that the damage event would not reduce the player's life total to
    less than 1, so it is not applied.  Then the damage event occurs.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.5 - Damage dealt to a creature or planeswalker doesn't destroy it.
    Likewise, the source of that damage doesn't destroy it.  Rather,
    state-based actions may destroy a creature or planeswalker, or otherwise
    put it into its owner's graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt
    to that permanent.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says "Lightning
    Bolt deals 3 damage to target creature or player," targeting a 2/2
    creature.  After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the
    creature is destroyed as a state-based action.  Neither Lightning Bolt nor
    the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  118.6 - Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if
    that permanent stops being a creature.  If the total damage marked on a
    creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been
    dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see
    Rule 704).  All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it
    regenerates (see Rule 701.11, "Regenerate") and during the cleanup
    step (see Rule 514.2). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 118.7 - The source of damage is the object that dealt it.  If an effect
    requires a player to choose a source of damage, he or she may choose a
    permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object
    referred to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement
    effect that's waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that's
    waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used
    to be in); or, in certain casual variant games, a face-up card in the
    command zone.  A source doesn't need to be capable of dealing damage to be
    a legal choice.  See Rule 609.7, "Sources of Damage."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  118.8 - If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all.
    That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won't trigger.  It
    also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt
    by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different
    object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

119 - Drawing a Card
  119.1 - A player draws a card by putting the top card of his or her library
    into his or her hand.  This is done as a turn-based action during each
    player's draw step.  It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a
    spell or ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.2 - Cards may only be drawn one at a time.  If a player is instructed to
    draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.2a - If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards, the
    active player performs all of his or her draws first, then each other
    player in turn order does the same. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.2b - If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a
    Two-Headed Giant game, first the primary player (seated on the right) on
    the active team performs all of his or her draws, then the secondary
    player on that team performs all of his or her draws, then the nonactive
    team does the same. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.3 - If there are no cards in a player's library and an effect offers
    that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so.
    However, if an effect says that a player can't draw cards and another
    effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can't
    choose to do so. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.4 - A player who attempts to draw a card from an empty library loses the
    game the next time a player would receive priority.  (This is a
    state-based action.  See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 119.5 - If an effect moves cards from a player's library to that player's
    hand without using the word "draw," the player has not drawn those cards.
    This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and
    effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player's library is
    empty. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  119.6 - Some effects replace card draws. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.6a - An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards
    could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player's
    library. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.6b - If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the
    replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.6c - Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it's drawn.
    If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any
    cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any
    subsequent replacement effects. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  119.7 - Some replacement effects result in multiple card draws.  In such a
    case, any parts of the original event that haven't been replaced by the
    effect occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

120 - Counters
  120.1 - A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies
    its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect.
    Counters are not objects and have no characteristics.  Notably, a counter
    is not a token, and a token is not a counter.  Counters with the same name
    or description are interchangeable. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  120.1a - A +X/+Y counter on a permanent, where X and Y are numbers, adds X
    to that permanent's power and Y to that permanent's toughness.
    Similarly, -X/-Y counters subtract from power and toughness.  See
    Rule 613.3. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  120.1b - The number of loyalty counters on a planeswalker on the battlefield
    indicates how much loyalty it has.  A planeswalker with 0 loyalty is put
    into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.  See Rule 704.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  120.1c - If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the
    game as a state-based action.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  120.2 - If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it,
    N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it as a state-based action,
    where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.
    See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 120.3 - If a permanent with an ability that says it can't have more than N
    counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on
    it, all but N of those counters are removed from it as a state-based
    action.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 120.4 - If an effect says to "move" a counter, it means to take that counter
    from the object it's currently on and put it onto a second object.  If the
    first and second objects are the same object, nothing happens.  If the
    first object has no counters, nothing happens; the second object doesn't
    get a counter put on it.  If the second object (or any possible second
    objects) are no longer in the correct zone when the effect would move the
    counter, nothing happens; a counter isn't removed from the first object.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 120.5 - If a spell or ability refers to a counter being "placed" on a
    permanent, it means putting a counter on that permanent while it's on the
    battlefield, or that permanent entering the battlefield with a counter on
    it. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

2 - Parts of a Card
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

200 - General
+ 200.1 - The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, type line,
    expansion symbol, text box, power and toughness, loyalty, hand modifier,
    life modifier, illustration credit, legal text, and collector number.
    Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  200.2 - Some parts of a card are also characteristics of the object that has
    them.  See Rule 109.3. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  200.3 - Objects that aren't cards (tokens, copies of cards, and copies of
    spells) may have some of the parts of a card, but only the ones that are
    also characteristics.  See Rule 110.5 and Rule 706. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

201 - Name
  201.1 - The name of a card is printed on its upper left corner.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  201.2 - Text that refers to the object it's on by name means just that
    particular object and not any other duplicates of it, regardless of any
    name changes caused by game effects. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  201.2a - If an ability of an object uses a phrase such as "this <something>"
    to identify an object, where <something> is a characteristic, it is
    referring to that particular object, even if it isn't the appropriate
    characteristic at the time. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability reads "Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.
    Destroy that creature at the beginning of the next end step."  The ability
    will destroy the object it gave +2/+2 even if that object isn't a creature
    at the beginning of the next end step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  201.2b - If an ability of an object grants to an object an ability that
    refers to the first object by name, the name refers only to the object
    whose ability grants that ability, not to any other object with the same
    name. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Saproling Burst has an ability that reads "Remove a fade
    counter from Saproling Burst: Put a green Saproling creature token onto
    the battlefield.  It has 'This creature's power and toughness are each
    equal to the number of fade counters on Saproling Burst.'"  The ability
    granted to the token only looks at the Saproling Burst that created the
    token, not at any other Saproling Burst on the battlefield.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  201.3 - Two cards have the same name if the English versions of their names
    are identical, regardless of anything else printed on the cards.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

202 - Mana Cost and Color
  202.1 - A card's mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the
    card.  (See Rule 107.4.)  On most cards, these symbols are printed in the
    upper right corner.  Some cards from the Future Sight set have alternate
    frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the art.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.1a - The mana cost of an object represents what a player must spend from
    his or her mana pool to cast that card.  Paying an object's mana cost
    requires matching the color of any colored mana symbols as well as paying
    the generic mana indicated in the cost. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 202.1b - Some objects have no mana cost.  This normally includes all land
    cards, any other cards that have no mana symbols where their mana cost
    would appear, tokens (unless the effect that creates them specifies
    otherwise), and nontraditional Magic cards.  Having no mana cost
    represents an unpayable cost (see Rule 116.6).  Note that lands are played
    without paying any costs (see Rule 305, "Lands"). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  202.2 - An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana
    cost, regardless of the color of its frame. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.2a - The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green.  The white
    mana symbol is represented by {W}, blue by {U}, black by {B}, red by {R},
    and green by {G}. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An object with a mana cost of {2}{W} is white, an object with a
    mana cost of {2} is colorless, and one with a mana cost of {2}{W}{B} is
    both white and black. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.2b - Objects with no colored mana symbols in their mana costs are
    colorless. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.2c - An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its
    mana cost is each of the colors of those mana symbols.  Most multicolored
    cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a
    card to be multicolored. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.2d - An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is
    all of the colors of those mana symbols, in addition to any other colors
    the object might be.  Most cards with hybrid mana symbols in their mana
    costs are printed in a two-tone frame.  See Rule 107.4e.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.2e - Effects may change an object's color or give a color to a colorless
    object; see Rule 105.3. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.3 - The converted mana cost of an object is a number equal to the total
    amount of mana in its mana cost, regardless of color.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A mana cost of {3}{U}{U} translates to a converted mana cost
    of 5. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.3a - The converted mana cost of an object with no mana cost is 0.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.3b - When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with an {X}
    in its mana cost, X is treated as 0 while the object is not on the stack,
    and X is treated as the number chosen for it while the object is on the
    stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.3c - When calculating the converted mana cost of an object with a hybrid
    mana symbol in its mana cost, use the largest component of each hybrid
    symbol. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {1}{W/U}{W/U}
    is 3. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The converted mana cost of a card with mana cost {2/B}{2/B}{2/B}
    is 6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  202.4 - Any additional cost listed in an object's rules text or imposed by
    an effect isn't part of the mana cost.  (See Rule 601, "Casting Spells.")
    Such costs are paid at the same time as the spell's other costs.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

203 - Illustration
  203.1 - The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no
    effect on game play.  For example, a creature doesn't have the flying
    ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it's depicted as flying.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

204 - Type Line
  204.1 - The type line is printed directly below the illustration.  It
    contains the card's card type(s).  It also contains the card's subtype(s)
    and supertype(s), if applicable. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 204.1a - When an object's card type changes, the new card type(s) replaces
    any existing card types.  Counters, effects, and damage marked on the
    object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type.
    Similarly, when one or more of an object's subtypes changes, the new
    subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate
    set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types,
    planeswalker types, or spell types).  If an object's card type is removed,
    the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also
    the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are
    also removed for the entire time the object's card type is removed.
    Removing an object's subtype doesn't affect its card types at all.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  204.1b - Some effects change an object's card type, supertype, or subtype
    but specify that the object retains a prior card type, supertype, or
    subtype.  In such cases, all the object's prior card types, supertypes,
    and subtypes are retained.  This rule applies to effects that use the
    phrase "in addition to its types" or that state that something is "still a
    <card type>."  Some effects state that an object becomes an "artifact
    creature"; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior
    card types and subtypes. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability reads, "All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still
    lands."  The affected lands now have two card types: creature and land.
    If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the ability's
    effect applied to them, those lands would become "artifact land
    creatures," not just "creatures," or "land creatures."  The effect allows
    them to retain both the card type "artifact" and the card type "land."
    Example: An ability reads, "All artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures."  If
    a permanent is both an artifact and an enchantment, it will become
    an "artifact enchantment creature." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.2 - Card Types [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 204.2a - The card types are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land,
    plane, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal.  See Section 3, "Card Types."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  204.2b - Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact
    creature).  Such objects satisfy the criteria for any effect that applies
    to any of their card types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.2c - Tokens have card types even though they aren't cards.  The same is
    true of copies of spells and copies of cards.
  204.3 - Subtypes [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3a - A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 204.3b - Subtypes of each card type except plane are always single words and
    are listed after a long dash.  Each word after the dash is a separate
    subtype; such objects may have multiple types.  Subtypes of planes are
    also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words.  Each word after
    the dash is, collectively, a single subtype. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: "Basic Land - Mountain" means the card is a land with the subtype
    Mountain. "Creature - Goblin Wizard" means the card is a creature with the
    subtypes Goblin and Wizard.  "Artifact - Equipment" means the card is an
    artifact with the subtype Equipment. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  204.3c - If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each
    subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Dryad Arbor's type line says "Land Creature -- Forest Dryad."
    Forest is a land type, and Dryad is a creature type.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3d - If an instruction requires choosing a subtype, you must choose one,
    and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype you choose must be for the
    appropriate card type.  For example, you can't choose a land type if an
    instruction requires choosing a creature type. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: When choosing a creature type, "Merfolk" or "Wizard" is
    acceptable, but "Merfolk Wizard" is not.  Words
    like "artifact," "opponent," "Swamp," or "truck" can't be chosen because
    they aren't creature types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3e - Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete.  Many
    cards have retroactively received subtypes.  Use the Oracle card reference
    to determine what a card's subtypes are.  (See Rule 108.1.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3f - Artifacts have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are
    called artifact types.  The artifact types are Contraption, Equipment (see
    Rule 301.7), and Fortification (see Rule 301.8). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3g - Enchantments have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes
    are called enchantment types.  The enchantment types are Aura (see
    Rule 303.4), and Shrine. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3h - Lands have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are
    called land types.  The land types are Desert, Forest, Island, Lair,
    Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, and Urza's.  Of
    that list, Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, and Swamp are the basic land
    types.  See Rule 305.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.3i - Planeswalkers have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes
    are called planeswalker types.  The planeswalker types are Ajani, Bolas,
    Chandra, Elspeth, Garruk, Jace, Liliana, Sarkhan, and Tezzeret.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    If two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type are on the
    battlefield, all are put into their owners' graveyards.
    This "planeswalker uniqueness rule" is a state-based action.  See
    Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 204.3j - Instants and sorceries share their lists of subtypes; these
    subtypes are called spell types.  The spell type are Arcane and Trap.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 204.3k - Creatures and tribals share their lists of subtypes; these subtypes
    are called creature types.  The creature types are Advisor, Ally, Angel,
    Anteater, Antelope, Ape, Archer, Archon, Artificer, Assassin,
    Assembly-Worker, Atog, Aurochs, Avatar, Badger, Barbarian, Basilisk, Bat,
    Bear, Beast, Beeble, Berserker, Bird, Blinkmoth, Boar, Bringer, Brushwagg,
    Camarid, Camel, Caribou, Carrier, Cat, Centaur, Cephalid, Chimera,
    Citizen, Cleric, Cockatrice, Construct, Coward, Crab, Crocodile, Cyclops,

    Weird, Whale, Wizard, Wolf, Wolverine, Wombat, Worm, Wraith, Wurm, Yeti,
    Zombie, and Zubera. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 204.3m - Planes have their own unique set of subtypes; these subtypes are
    called planar types.  The planar types are Alara, Arkhos, Bolas's
    Meditation Realm, Dominaria, Equilor, Iquatana, Ir, Kaldheim, Kamigawa,
    Lorwyn, Mercadia, Mirrodin, Moag, Muraganda, Phyrexia, Rabiah, Rath,
    Ravnica, Segovia, Serra's Realm, Shadowmoor, Shandalar, Ulgrotha, Valla,
    Wildfire, and Zendikar. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 204.3n - Vanguard cards have no subtypes. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  204.4 - Supertypes [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4a - A card can also have one or more supertypes.  These are printed
    directly before its card types.  The supertypes are basic, legendary,
    snow, and world. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4b - An object's supertype is independent of its card type and subtype,
    even though some supertypes are closely identified with specific card
    types.  Changing an object's card types or subtypes won't change its
    supertypes.  Changing an object's supertypes won't change its card types
    or subtypes.  When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any
    other supertypes it had. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability reads, "All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still
    lands."  If any of the affected lands were legendary, they are still
    legendary. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4c - Any land with the supertype "basic" is a basic land.  Any land that
    doesn't have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic
    land type. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Cards printed in sets prior to the Eighth Edition core set didn't use the
    word "basic" to indicate a basic land.  Cards from those sets with the
    following names are basic lands and have received errata in the Oracle
    card reference accordingly: Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains,
    Swamp, Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Island,
    Snow-Covered Mountain, Snow-Covered Plains, and
    Snow-Covered Swamp. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4d - Any permanent with the supertype "legendary" is subject to the
    state-based action for legendary permanents, also called the "legend
    rule" (see Rule 704.5k). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4e - Any permanent with the supertype "world" is subject to the
    state-based action for world permanents, also called the "world rule" (see
    Rule 704.5m). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  204.4f - Any permanent with the supertype "snow" is a snow permanent.  Any
    permanent that doesn't have this supertype is a nonsnow permanent,
    regardless of its name. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

205 - Expansion Symbol
  205.1 - The expansion symbol indicates which Magic set a card is from.  It's
    a small icon normally printed below the right edge of the illustration.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 205.2 - The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card
    within its set.  A red-orange symbol indicates the card is mythic rare.  A
    gold symbol indicates the card is rare.  A silver symbol indicates the
    card is uncommon.  A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or
    is a basic land.  A purple symbol signifies a special rarity; to date,
    only the Time Spiral "timeshifted" cards, which were rarer than that set's
    rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols.  (Prior to the Exodus set,
    all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity.  Also, prior to
    the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Chinese Fifth
    Edition core set, Magic core sets didn't have expansion symbols at all.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  205.3 - A spell or ability that affects cards from a particular set checks
    only for that set's expansion symbol.  A card reprinted in the core set or
    another expansion receives that set's expansion symbol.  Any reprinted
    version of the card no longer counts as part of its original set unless it
    was reprinted with that set's expansion symbol. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  205.4 - Players may include cards from any printing in their constructed
    decks if those cards appear in sets allowed in that format (or those cards
    are specifically allowed by the Magic Tournament Rules).  See the Magic
    Tournament Rules for the current definitions of the constructed
    formats (http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?
    x=dci/doccenter/home). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  205.5 - The full list of expansions and expansion symbols can be found in
    the Magic Products section of the Wizards of the Coast
    website (http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?
    x=mtg/tcg/products/allproducts). [CompRules 2009/07/08]

206 - Text Box
  206.1 - The text box is printed on the lower half of the card.  It usually
    contains rules text defining the card's abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  206.2 - The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game
    function. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  206.2a - Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes
    a rule that applies to that card.  It usually appears on the same line as
    the ability it's relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it
    applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  206.2b - Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds
    artistic appeal to the game.  It appears below the rules text.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 206.2c - An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some
    abilities on cards.  Ability words are similar to keywords in that they
    tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no
    special rules meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive
    Rules.  The ability words are channel, chroma, domain, grandeur, hellbent,
    imprint, kinship, landfall, radiance, sweep, and threshold.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  206.3 - A guild icon appears in the text box of many Ravnica block cards.
    These cards either have the specified guild's exclusive mechanic or
    somehow relate to the two colors associated with that guild.  Guild icons
    have no effect on game play. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 206.4 - The chaos symbol {C} appears in the text box of each plane card to
    the left of a triggered ability that triggers whenever {C} is rolled on
    the planar die.  The symbol itself has no special rules meaning.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

207 - Power/Toughness
  207.1 - A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its
    lower right corner.  The first number is its power (the amount of damage
    it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage
    needed to destroy it).  For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and
    toughness 3.  Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular
    values by effects. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  207.2 - Some creature cards have power and/or toughness represented by a *
    instead of a number. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 207.2a - The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its
    power and/or toughness according to some stated condition.  (See
    Rule 604.3.)  Such an ability is worded "<This creature's> <power or
    toughness> is equal to ..." or "<This creature's> power and toughness are
    each equal to ..."  This ability functions everywhere, even outside the
    game.  If the ability needs to use a number that can't be determined,
    use 0 instead of that number. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Lost Order of Jarkeld has power and toughness each equal
    to 1+*.  It says "As Lost Order of Jarkeld enters the battlefield, choose
    an opponent" and "Lost Order of Jarkeld's power and toughness are each
    equal to 1 plus the number of creatures that opponent controls."  While
    Lost Order of Jarkeld isn't on the battlefield, there won't be a chosen
    opponent.  Its power and toughness will each be equal to 1 plus 0, so
    it's 1/1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  207.2b - The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement
    effect that sets the creature's power and toughness to one of a number of
    specific choices as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up.  (See
    Rule 614, "Replacement Effects.")  Such an ability is worded "As <this
    creature> enters the battlefield ... ," "As <this creature> is turned face
    up ... ," or "<This creature> enters the battlefield as ..." and lists two
    or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional
    characteristics).  The characteristics chosen with these effects affect
    the creature's copiable values; see Rule 706.2.  While the card isn't on
    the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  207.3 - A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it's a
    card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Licid that's
    become an Aura). [CompRules 2009/07/08]

208 - Loyalty
  208.1 - Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower
    right corner.  This indicates its loyalty while it's not on the
    battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the
    battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 208.2 - An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty
    ability.  Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a
    loyalty ability of a permanent he or she controls any time he or she has
    priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn,
    but only if none of that permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated
    that turn.  See Rule 606, "Loyalty Abilities." [CompRules 2009/10/01]

209 - Hand Modifier
+ 209.1 - Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left
    corner.  This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a
    minus sign, or a zero.  This modifier is applied to the maximum hand size
    of the vanguard card's owner (normally seven) to determine both how many
    cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and his or her
    maximum hand size. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

210 - Life Modifier
+ 210.1 - Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right
    corner.  This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a
    minus sign, or a zero.  This modifier is applied to the starting life
    total of the vanguard card's owner (normally 20) to determine how much
    life that player begins the game with. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

211 - Information Below the Text Box
+ 211.1 - Each card features text printed below the text box that has no
    effect on game play. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 211.1a - The illustration credit for a card is printed on the first line
    below the text box.  It follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards,
    the abbreviation "Illus." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 211.1b - Legal text (the fine print at the bottom of the card) lists the
    trademark and copyright information. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 211.1c - Some card sets feature collector numbers.  This information is
    printed in the form <card number>/<total cards in the set>, immediately
    following the legal text. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

3 - Card Types
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

300 - General
+ 300.1 - The card types are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land,
    plane, planeswalker, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  300.2 - Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact
    creature).  Such objects satisfy the criteria for any effect that applies
    to any of their card types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

301 - Artifacts
  301.1 - A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from his or her
    hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.
    Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack.  (See Rule 601, "Casting
    Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.2 - When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the
    battlefield under his or her control. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.3 - Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a
    long dash: "Artifact -- Equipment."  Artifact subtypes are also called
    artifact types.  Artifacts may have multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3f
    for the complete list of artifact types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.4 - Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type.  Most
    artifacts have no colored mana symbols in their mana costs, and are
    therefore colorless.  However, there is no correlation between being
    colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless
    objects may be card types other than artifact. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.5 - Artifact creatures combine the characteristics of both creatures and
    artifacts, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or
    both card types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.6 - Artifact lands combine the characteristics of both lands and
    artifacts, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or
    both card types.  Artifact lands can only be played as lands.  They can't
    be cast as spells. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.7 - Some artifacts have the subtype "Equipment."  An Equipment can be
    attached to a creature.  It can't legally be attached to an object that
    isn't a creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.7a - An Equipment is cast and enters the battlefield just like any other
    artifact.  An Equipment doesn't enter the battlefield attached to a
    creature.  The equip keyword ability moves the Equipment onto a creature
    you control (see Rule 702.6, "Equip").  Control of the creature matters
    only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves.  The
    creature to which the Equipment is to be moved must be able to be equipped
    by it.  If it can't, the Equipment doesn't move. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.7b - An Equipment that's also a creature can't equip a creature.
    Equipment that loses the subtype "Equipment" can't equip a creature.  An
    Equipment can't equip itself.  An Equipment that equips an illegal or
    nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains
    on the battlefield.  (This is a state-based action.  See Rule 704.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.7c - The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the "equipped
    creature."  The Equipment is attached to, or "equips," that creature.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  301.7d - An Equipment's controller is separate from the equipped creature's
    controller; the two need not be the same.  Changing control of the
    creature doesn't change control of the Equipment, and vice versa.  Only
    the Equipment's controller can activate its abilities.  However, if the
    Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with "gains"
    or "has"), the equipped creature's controller is the only one who can
    activate that ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 301.8 - Some artifacts have the subtype "Fortification."  A Fortification
    can be attached to a land.  It can't legally be attached to an object that
    isn't a land.  Rule 301.7a through Rule 301.7d apply to Fortifications in
    relation to lands just as they apply to Equipment in relation to
    creatures, with one clarification relating to Rule 301.7b: a Fortification
    that's also a creature (not a land) can't equip a land.  Fortification's
    analog to the equip keyword ability is the fortify keyword ability.  (See
    Rule 702.64, "Fortify.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]

302 - Creatures
  302.1 - A player who has priority may cast a creature card from his or her
    hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.
    Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack.  (See Rule 601, "Casting
    Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.2 - When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the
    battlefield under his or her control. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.3 - Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a
    long dash: "Creature -- Human Soldier," "Artifact Creature -- Golem," and
    so on.  Creature subtypes are also called creature types.  Creatures may
    have multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3k for the complete list of creature
    types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: "Creature -- Goblin Wizard" means the card is a creature with the
    subtypes Goblin and Wizard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.4 - Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.4a - A creature's power is the amount of damage it deals in combat.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.4b - A creature's toughness is the amount of damage needed to destroy
    it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.4c - To determine a creature's power and toughness, start with the
    numbers printed in its lower right corner, then apply any applicable
    continuous effects.  (See Rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.5 - Creatures can attack and block.  (See Rule 508, "Declare Attackers
    Step," and Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.6 - A creature's activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap
    symbol in its activation cost can't be activated unless the creature has
    been under its controller's control continuously since his or her most
    recent turn began.  A creature can't attack unless it has been under its
    controller's control continuously since his or her most recent turn began.
    This rule is informally called the "summoning sickness" rule.  Ignore this
    rule for creatures with haste (see Rule 702.10). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.7 - Damage dealt to a creature by a source without wither is marked on
    that creature.  If the total damage marked on that creature is greater
    than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage
    and is destroyed as a state-based action (see Rule 704).  All damage
    marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see
    Rule 701.11, "Regenerate") and during the cleanup step (see Rule 514.2).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  302.8 - Creature lands combine the characteristics of both lands and
    creatures, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or
    both card types.  Creature lands can only be played as lands.  They can't
    be cast as spells. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

303 - Enchantments
  303.1 - A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from his or
    her hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.
    Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack.  (See Rule 601, "Casting
    Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.2 - When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the
    battlefield under his or her control. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.3 - Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a
    long dash: "Enchantment -- Shrine."  Each word after the dash is a
    separate subtype.  Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types.
    Enchantments may have multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3g for the complete
    list of enchantment types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.4 - Some enchantments have the subtype "Aura."  An Aura enters the
    battlefield attached to an object or player.  What an Aura can be attached
    to is restricted by its enchant keyword ability (see
    Rule 702.5, "Enchant").  Other effects can limit what a permanent can be
    enchanted by. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.4a - An Aura spell requires a target, which is restricted by its enchant
    ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.4b - If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player, the object it
    was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has
    left the game, the Aura is put into its owner's graveyard.  (This is a
    state-based action.  See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 303.4c - An Aura can't enchant itself.  If this occurs somehow, the Aura is
    put into its owner's graveyard.  An Aura that's also a creature can't
    enchant anything.  If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached,
    then is put into its owner's graveyard.  (These are a state-based actions.
    See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  303.4d - The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted.
    The Aura is attached to, or "enchants," that object or player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 303.4e - An Aura's controller is separate from the enchanted object's
    controller or the enchanted player; the two need not be the same.  If an
    Aura enchants and object, changing control of the object doesn't change
    control of the Aura, and vice versa.  Only the Aura's controller can
    activate its abilities.  However, if the Aura grants an ability to the
    enchanted object (with "gains" or "has"), the enchanted object's
    controller is the only one who can activate that ability.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  303.4f - If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a player's control by
    any means other than by resolving as an Aura spell, and the effect putting
    it onto the battlefield doesn't specify the object or player the Aura will
    enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the
    battlefield.  The player must choose a legal object or player according to
    the Aura's enchant ability and any other applicable effects.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.4g - If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object
    or player for it to enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless
    that zone is the stack.  In that case, the Aura is put into its owner's
    graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  303.4h - If an effect attempts to attach an Aura on the battlefield to an
    object or player, that object or player must be able to be enchanted by
    it.  If the object or player can't be, the Aura doesn't move.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

304 - Instants
  304.1 - A player who has priority may cast an instant card from his or her
    hand.  Casting an instant as a spell uses the stack.  (See
    Rule 601, "Casting Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  304.2 - When an instant spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text
    are followed.  Then it's put into its owner's graveyard.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  304.3 - Instant subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a
    long dash: "Instant -- Arcane."  Each word after the dash is a separate
    subtype.  The set of instant subtypes is the same as the set of sorcery
    subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types.  Instants may have
    multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3j for the complete list of spell types.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  304.4 - Instants can't enter the battlefield.  If an instant would enter the
    battlefield, it remains in its previous zone instead.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  304.5 - If text states that a player may do something "any time he or she
    could cast an instant," it means only that the player must have priority.
    The player doesn't need to have an instant he or she could actually cast.
    Effects that would prevent that player from casting a spell or casting an
    instant don't affect the player's capability to perform that
    action (unless the action is actually casting a spell or casting an
    instant). [CompRules 2009/07/08]

305 - Lands
+ 305.1 - A player who has priority may play a land card from his or her hand
    during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.  Playing a
    land is a special action; it doesn't use the stack (see Rule 114). Rather,
    the player simply puts the land onto the battlefield.  Since the land
    doesn't go on the stack, it is never a spell, and players can't respond to
    it with instants or activated abilities. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 305.2 - A player may normally play only one land during his or her turn;
    however, continuous effects may increase this number.  If any such effects
    exist, the player announces which effect, or this rule, applies to each
    land play as it happens. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  305.3 - A player can't play a land, for any reason, if it isn't his or her
    turn.  Ignore any part of an effect that instructs a player to do so.
    Similarly, a player can't play a land, for any reason, if that player has
    used all of his or her land plays for that turn.  Ignore any part of an
    effect that instructs a player to do so. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.4 - Effects may also allow players to "put" lands onto the battlefield.
    This isn't the same as "playing a land" and doesn't count as a player's
    one land played during his or her turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.5 - Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long
    dash.  Land subtypes are also called land types.  Lands may have multiple
    subtypes.  See Rule 204.3h for the complete list of land types.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: "Basic Land -- Mountain" means the card is a land with the
    Mountain subtype. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.6 - The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and
    Forest.  If an object uses the words "basic land type," it's referring to
    one of these subtypes.  A basic land type implies an intrinsic ability to
    produce colored mana.  (See Rule 605, "Mana Abilities.")  An object with a
    basic land type is treated as if its text box included "{Tap}: Add <mana
    symbol> to your mana pool," even if the text box doesn't actually contain
    text or the object has no text box.  Plains produce white mana; Islands,
    blue; Swamps, black; Mountains, red; and Forests, green.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.7 - If an effect changes a land's subtype to one or more of the basic
    land types, the land no longer has its old land type.  It loses all
    abilities generated from its rules text and its old land types, and it
    gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type.  Note
    that this doesn't remove any abilities that were granted to the land by
    other effects.  Changing a land's subtype doesn't add or remove any card
    types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and
    snow) the land may have.  If a land gains one or more land types in
    addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains
    the new land types and mana abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.8 - Any land with the supertype "basic" is a basic land.  Any land that
    doesn't have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic
    land type. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  305.9 - If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played
    only as a land.  It can't be played as a spell. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

306 - Planeswalkers
  306.1 - A player who has priority may cast a planeswalker card from his or
    her hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.
    Casting a planeswalker as a spell uses the stack.  (See Rule 601, "Casting
    Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.2 - When a planeswalker spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the
    battlefield under his or her control. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.3 - Planeswalker subtypes are always a single word and are listed after
    a long dash: "Planeswalker -- Jace."  Each word after the dash is a
    separate subtype.  Planeswalker subtypes are also called planeswalker
    types.  Planeswalkers may have multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3i for the
    complete list of planeswalker types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.4 - If two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type are on
    the battlefield, all are put into their owners' graveyards as a
    state-based action.  This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."
    See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.5 - Loyalty is a characteristic only planeswalkers have.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.5a - The loyalty of a planeswalker not on the battlefield is equal to
    the number printed in its lower right corner. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.5b - A planeswalker is treated as if its text box included, "This
    permanent enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it
    equal to its printed loyalty number."  This ability creates a replacement
    effect (see Rule 614.1c). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  306.5c - The loyalty of a planeswalker on the battlefield is equal to the
    number of loyalty counters on it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 306.5d - Each planeswalker has a number of loyalty abilities, which are
    activated abilities with loyalty symbols in their costs.  Loyalty
    abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of
    a permanent he or she controls any time he or she has priority and the
    stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn, but only if none of
    that permanent's loyalty abilities have been activated that turn.  See
    Rule 606, "Loyalty Abilities." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  306.6 - Planeswalkers can be attacked.  (See Rule 508, "Declare Attackers
    Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 306.7 - If noncombat damage would be dealt to a player by a source
    controlled by an opponent, that opponent may have that source deal that
    damage to a planeswalker the first player controls instead.  This is a
    redirection effect (see Rule 614.9) and is subject to the normal rules for
    ordering replacement effects (see Rule 616).  The opponent chooses whether
    to redirect the damage as the redirection effect is applied.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 306.8 - Damage dealt to a planeswalker results in that many loyalty counters
    being removed from it. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 306.9 - If a planeswalker's loyalty is 0, it's put into its owner's
    graveyard as a state-based action.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

307 - Sorceries
  307.1 - A player who has priority may cast a sorcery card from his or her
    hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.
    Casting a sorcery as a spell uses the stack.  (See Rule 601, "Casting
    Spells.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  307.2 - When a sorcery spell resolves, the actions stated in its rules text
    are followed.  Then it's put into its owner's graveyard.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  307.3 - Sorcery subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a
    long dash: "Sorcery -- Arcane."  Each word after the dash is a separate
    subtype.  The set of sorcery subtypes is the same as the set of instant
    subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types.  Sorceries may have
    multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3j for the complete list of spell types.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  307.4 - Sorceries can't enter the battlefield.  If a sorcery would enter the
    battlefield, it remains in its previous zone instead.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  307.5 - If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something
    only "any time he or she could cast a sorcery," it means only that the
    player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of his or her
    turn, and the stack must be empty.  The player doesn't need to have a
    sorcery he or she could actually cast.  Effects that would prevent that
    player from casting a spell or casting a sorcery don't affect the player's
    capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a
    spell or casting a sorcery). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  307.5a - Similarly, if an effect checks to see if a spell was cast "any time
    a sorcery couldn't have been cast," it's checking only whether the spell's
    controller cast it without having priority, during a phase other than his
    or her main phase, or while another object was on the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

308 - Tribals
  308.1 - Each tribal card has another card type.  Casting and resolving a
    tribal card follows the rules for casting and resolving a card of the
    other card type. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  308.2 - Tribal subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long
    dash: "Tribal Enchantment -- Merfolk."  The set of tribal subtypes is the
    same as the set of creature subtypes; these subtypes are called creature
    types.  Tribals may have multiple subtypes.  See Rule 204.3k for the
    complete list of creature types. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

309 - Planes
+ 309.1 - Plane is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards.  Only
    the Planar Magic casual variant uses plane cards.  See
    Section 901, "Planar Magic." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.2 - Plane cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both
    while they're part of a planar deck and while they're face up.  They're
    not permanents.  They can't be cast.  If a plane card would leave the
    command zone, it remains in the command zone. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.3 - Plane subtypes are listed after a long dash, and may be multiple
    words: "Plane - Serra's Realm."  Each word after the dash is,
    collectively, a single subtype.  Planar subtypes are called planar types.
    A plane can have only one subtype.  See Rule 204.3m for the complete list
    of planar types. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.4 - A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or
    activated abilities.  As long as a plane card is face up in the command
    zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may
    trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.5 - The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as
    the planar controller.  Normally, the planar controller is whoever the
    active player is.  However, if the current planar controller would leave
    the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the
    game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves
    the game.  The new planar controller retains that designation until he or
    she leaves the game or a different player becomes the active player,
    whichever comes first. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.6 - A plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll
    {P}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down,
    then move the top card of your planar deck face up."  This is called
    the "planeswalking ability."  A face-up plane card that's turned face down
    becomes a new object. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 309.7 - Each plane card has a triggered ability that triggers "Whenever you
    roll {C}."  These are called "chaos abilities."  Each one is indicated by
    a {C} to its left, though the symbol itself has no special rules meaning.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

310 - Vanguards
+ 310.1 - Vanguard is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards.
    Only the Vanguard casual variant uses vanguards.  See
    Section 902, "Vanguard." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.2 - Vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.
    They're not permanents.  They can't be cast.  If a vanguard card would
    leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.3 - Vanguard cards have no subtypes. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.4 - A vanguard card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or
    activated abilities.  As long as a vanguard card is in the command zone,
    its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger,
    and its activated abilities may be activated. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.5 - The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with
    it in the command zone.  The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its
    owner. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.6 - Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left
    corner.  This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a
    minus sign, or a zero.  This modifier is applied to the maximum hand size
    of the vanguard card's owner (normally seven) to determine both how many
    cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and his or her
    maximum hand size. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 310.7 - Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right
    corner.  This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a
    minus sign, or a zero.  This modifier is applied to the starting life
    total of the vanguard card's owner (normally 20) to determine how much
    life that player begins the game with. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

4 - Zones
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

400 - General
+ 400.1 - A zone is a place where objects can be during a game.  There are
    normally six zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, and
    exile.  Some older cards also use the ante zone.  Some casual variants use
    the command zone. (See Section 9, "Casual Variants.")  Each player has his
    or her own library, hand, and graveyard.  The other zones are shared by
    all players. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.2 - Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards'
    faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow
    to be face down.  Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command
    are public zones.  Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be
    expected to see the cards's faces.  Library and hand are hidden zones,
    even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  400.3 - If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than
    its owner's, it goes to its owner's corresponding zone.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 400.4 - Cards with certain card types can't enter certain zones.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.4a - If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it
    remains in its previous zone. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.4b - If a plane card would leave the command zone, it remains in the
    command zone. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.5 - The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack
    can't be changed except when effects or rules allow it.  The same is true
    for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones.  Other objects in
    other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who
    controls those objects, whether they're tapped or flipped, and what other
    objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  400.6 - If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what
    event is moving the object.  If the object is moving to a public zone, its
    owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the
    move.  Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from
    that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event.  If any effects
    or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things
    to a particular object, that object's controller--or its owner if it has
    no controller--chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect
    does.  (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually
    exclusive; for example, two simultaneous "destroy" effects.)  Then the
    event moves the object. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7 - An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object
    with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence.  There are six
    exceptions to this rule: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7a - Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities
    that change the characteristics of a permanent spell on the stack continue
    to apply to the permanent that spell becomes. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7b - Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on
    the stack continue to apply to damage from the permanent that spell
    becomes. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7c - Abilities of a permanent that require information about choices
    made when that permanent was cast use information about the spell that
    became that permanent. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7d - Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to
    another (for example, "When Rancor is put into a graveyard from the
    battlefield") can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved
    to when the ability triggered. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7e - Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves
    the battlefield can find the new object that Aura became in its owner's
    graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not
    being attached to a permanent.  (See Rule 704.5n.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.7f - If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be
    cast, that ability will continue to apply to the new object that card
    became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  400.8 - If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesn't change zones,
    but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 400.9 - If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it
    becomes a new object. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.10 - An object is outside the game if it isn't in any of the game's
    zones.  Outside the game is not a zone. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.10a - Cards in a player's sideboard are outside the game.  See
    Rule 100.2 and Rule 100.4. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 400.11 - Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such
    as "Shuffle your hand into your library.")  That action is performed on
    all cards in that zone.  The zone itself is not affected.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

401 - Library
  401.1 - When a game begins, each player's deck becomes his or her library.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  401.2 - Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile.  Players can't
    look at or change the order of cards in a library. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  401.3 - Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player's
    library at any time. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  401.4 - If an effect puts two or more cards on the top or bottom of a
    library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any
    order.  That library's owner doesn't reveal the order in which the cards
    go into his or her library. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  401.5 - If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell
    is being cast, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell becomes
    cast (see Rule 601.2h).  The same is true with relation to another ability
    being activated. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 401.6 - Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of his or her
    library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of his or
    her library.  If the top card of the player's library changes while a
    spell is being cast, the new top card won't be revealed and can't be
    looked at until the spell becomes cast (see Rule 601.2).  The same is true
    with relation to an ability being activated. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  401.7 - If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of his or her
    library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any
    length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

402 - Hand
  402.1 - The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn but not
    yet played.  At the beginning of the game, each player draws a hand of
    seven cards.  (See Rule 103, "Starting the Game.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  402.2 - Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards.
    A player may have any number of cards in his or her hand, but as part of
    his or her cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the
    maximum hand size. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  402.3 - A player may arrange his or her hand in any convenient fashion and
    look at it as much as he or she wishes.  A player can't look at the cards
    in another player's hand but may count those cards at any time.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

403 - Battlefield
  403.1 - Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield.
    The battlefield starts out empty.  Permanents a player controls are
    normally kept in front of him or her on the battlefield, though there are
    some cases (such as an Aura attached to another player's permanent) when a
    permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  403.2 - A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it
    specifically mentions a player or another zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  403.3 - Permanents exist only on the battlefield.  Every object on the
    battlefield is a permanent.  See Rule 110, "Permanents."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  403.4 - Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object
    and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same
    card, except for the cases listed in Rule 400.7.  (This is also true for
    any objects entering any zone.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 403.5 - For many years, the battlefield was called the "in-play zone." Cards
    that were printed with text that contains the phrases "in play," "from
    play," "into play," or the like are referring to the battlefield.  Cards
    that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
    reference. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

404 - Graveyard
  404.1 - A player's graveyard is his or her discard pile.  Any object that's
    countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its
    owner's graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that's finished
    resolving.  Each player's graveyard starts out empty.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  404.2 - Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile.  A player can
    examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally can't change
    their order.  Additional rules applying to DCI-sanctioned tournaments may
    allow a player to change the order of cards in his or her graveyard.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  404.3 - If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard
    at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

405 - Stack
  405.1 - When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see
    Rule 601.2a).  When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of
    the stack without any card associated with it (see Rule 602.2a and
    Rule 603.3). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.2 - The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were
    added to it.  Each time an object is put on the stack, it's put on top of
    all objects already there. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.3 - If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time,
    those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each
    other player's objects in APNAP order (see Rule 101.4).  If a player
    controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their
    relative order on the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.4 - Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with
    it.  Each activated or triggered ability that's on the stack has the text
    of the ability that created it and no other characteristics.  The
    controller of a spell is the person who cast the spell.  The controller of
    an activated ability is the player who activated the ability.  The
    controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the
    ability's source when it triggered, unless it's a delayed triggered
    ability.  The controller of a delayed triggered ability is the player who
    controlled the spell or ability that created it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.5 - When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or
    ability on the stack resolves.  If the stack is empty when all players
    pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6 - Some things that happen during the game don't use the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6a - Effects don't go on the stack; they're the result of spells and
    abilities resolving.  Effects may create delayed triggered abilities,
    however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see Rule 603.7).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6b - Static abilities continuously generate effects and don't go on the
    stack.  (See Rule 604, "Handling Static Abilities.")  This includes
    characteristic-defining abilities such as "<This object> is red" (see
    Rule 604.3). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 405.6c - Mana abilities resolve immediately.  If a mana ability produces
    both mana and another effect, both the mana and the other effect happen
    immediately.  If a player had priority before a mana ability was
    activated, that player gets priority after it resolves.  (See
    Rule 605, "Mana Abilities.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  405.6d - Special actions don't use the stack; they happen immediately.  See
    Rule 114, "Special Actions." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6e - Turn-based actions don't use the stack; they happen automatically
    when certain steps or phases begin.  They're dealt with before a player
    would receive priority (see Rule 115.3a).  Turn-based actions also happen
    automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority
    afterward.  See Rule 703. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6f - State-based actions don't use the stack; they happen automatically
    when certain conditions are met.  See Rule 704.  They are dealt with
    before a player would receive priority.  See Rule 115.5.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6g - A player may concede the game at any time.  That player leaves the
    game immediately.  See Rule 104.3a. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  405.6h - If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game,
    cease to exist, change control, or be exiled as a result.  These actions
    happen immediately.  See Rule 800.4a. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

406 - Exile
  406.1 - The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects.  Some
    spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object
    to another zone.  Other spells and abilities exile an object only
    temporarily. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  406.2 - To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever
    zone it's currently in.  An exiled card is a card that's been put into the
    exile zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  406.3 - Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by
    any player at any time.  Cards "exiled face down" can't be examined by any
    player except when instructions allow it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 406.4 - Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone
    should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of
    returning.  Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their
    own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards
    that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  406.5 - An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more
    cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to "the exiled
    cards" or to cards "exiled with <this object>."  These abilities are
    linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the
    first.  See Rule 607, "Linked Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  406.6 - If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesn't change
    zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 406.7 - For many years, the exile zone was called the "removed-from-the-game
    zone."  Cards that were printed with text that "removes <an object> from
    the game" exiles that object.  The same is true for cards printed with
    text that "sets <an object> aside."  Cards that were printed with that
    text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

407 - Ante
  407.1 - Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way
    of playing "for keeps."  Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an
    optional variation on the game, and it's allowed only where it's not
    forbidden by law or by other rules.  Playing for ante is strictly
    forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament
    Rules (http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  407.2 - When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from his or
    her deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but
    before players draw any cards.  Cards in the ante zone may be examined by
    any player at any time.  At the end of the game, the winner becomes the
    owner of all the cards in the ante zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  407.3 - A few cards have the text "Remove <this card> from your deck before
    playing if you're not playing for ante."  These are the only cards that
    can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a card's owner.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  407.4 - To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from
    whichever zone it's currently in.  The owner of an object is the only
    person who can ante that object. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

408 - Command
+ 408.1 - In certain casual variants, nontraditional Magic cards and/or
    specially designated cards start the game in the command zone.  Each
    variant has its own rules regarding such cards.  See Section 9, "Casual
    Variants." [CompRules 2009/10/01]

5 - Turn Structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

500 - General
  500.1 - A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat
    main, combat, postcombat main, and ending.  Each of these phases takes
    place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase.  The
    beginning, combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps,
    which proceed in order. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 500.2 - A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the
    stack is empty and all players pass in succession.  Simply having the
    stack become empty doesn't cause such a phase or step to end; all players
    have to pass in succession with the stack empty.  Because of this, each
    player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before that phase or
    step ends. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  500.3 - A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified
    actions that take place during that step are completed.  The only such
    steps are the untap step (see Rule 502) and certain cleanup steps (see
    Rule 514). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 500.4 - When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player's mana
    pool empties.  This turn-based action doesn't use the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  500.5 - When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last "until end
    of" that phase or step expire.  When a phase or step begins, any effects
    scheduled to last "until" that phase or step expire.  Effects that
    last "until end of combat" expire at the end of the combat phase, not at
    the beginning of the end of combat step.  Effects that last "until end of
    turn" are subject to special rules; see Rule 514.2. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.6 - When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger "at the
    beginning of" that phase or step are added to the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.7 - Some effects can give a player extra turns.  They do this by adding
    the turns directly after the current turn.  If a player gets multiple
    extra turns or if multiple players get extra turns during a single turn,
    the extra turns are added one at a time.  The most recently created turn
    will be taken first. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.8 - Some effects can add phases to a turn.  They do this by adding the
    phases directly after the specified phase.  If multiple extra phases are
    created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur
    first. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.9 - Some effects can add steps to a phase.  They do this by adding the
    steps directly after a specified step or directly before a specified step.
    If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most recently
    created step will occur first. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.10 - Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped.  To
    skip a step, phase, or turn is to proceed past it as though it didn't
    exist.  See Rule 614.10. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  500.11 - No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

501 - Beginning Phase
  501.1 - The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap,
    upkeep, and draw. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

502 - Untap Step
  502.1 - First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player
    controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player
    controlled when they phased out phase in.  This all happens
    simultaneously.  This turn-based action doesn't use the stack.  See
    Rule 702.23, "Phasing." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  502.2 - Second, the active player determines which permanents he or she
    controls will untap.  Then he or she untaps them all simultaneously.  This
    turn-based action doesn't use the stack.  Normally, all of a player's
    permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player's
    permanents from untapping. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 502.3 - No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can
    be cast or resolve and no abilities can be activated or resolved.  Any
    ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next time a
    player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep
    step.  (See Rule 503, "Upkeep Step.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]

503 - Upkeep Step
  503.1 - First, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the upkeep
    step and any abilities that triggered during the turn's untap step go on
    the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  503.2 - Second, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

504 - Draw Step
  504.1 - First, the active player draws a card.  This turn-based action
    doesn't use the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  504.2 - Second, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the draw step
    and any other abilities that have triggered go on the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  504.3 - Third, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells and
    activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

505 - Main Phase
  505.1 - There are two main phases in a turn.  In each turn, the first main
    phase (also known as the precombat main phase) and the second main
    phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the
    combat phase (see Rule 506, "Combat Phase").  The precombat and postcombat
    main phases are individually and collectively known as the main phase.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.1a - If an effect causes a turn to have an additional combat phase and
    an additional main phase, the additional main phase is also a postcombat
    main phase. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.2 - The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players
    pass in succession while the stack is empty.  (See Rule 500.2.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.3 - First, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the main phase
    go on the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.4 - Second, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities.  The active player may play a land.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.4a - The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally
    cast artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and sorcery spells.
    Only the active player may cast these spells. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  505.4b - During either main phase, the active player may play one land card
    from his or her hand if the stack is empty, if the player has priority,
    and if he or she hasn't yet taken this special action this turn.  (See
    Rule 305, "Lands.")  This action doesn't use the stack.  Neither the land
    nor the action of playing the land is a spell or ability, so it can't be
    countered, and players can't respond to it with instants or activated
    abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

506 - Combat Phase
  506.1 - The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning
    of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of
    combat.  The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no
    creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield
    attacking (see Rule 508.5).  There are two combat damage steps if any
    attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see Rule 702.7) or double
    strike (see Rule 702.4). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.2 - During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player;
    creatures that player controls may attack.  During the combat phase of a
    two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player
    and planeswalkers he or she controls may be attacked.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 506.2a - During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or
    more defending players, depending on the variant being played and the
    options chosen for it.  Unless all the attacking player's opponents
    automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the
    attacking player chooses one of his or her opponents as a turn-based
    action during the beginning of combat step.  (Note that the choice may be
    dictated by the variant being played or the options chosen for it.)  That
    player becomes the defending player.  See Rule 802, "Attack Multiple
    Players Option," Rule 803, "Attack Left and Attack Right Options," and
    Rule 807, "Emperor Variant." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  506.2b - In the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, the nonactive team is
    the defending team.  See Rule 806, "Two-Headed Giant Variant."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.3 - Only a creature can attack or block.  Only a player or a
    planeswalker can be attacked. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.3a - If an effect would put a noncreature permanent onto the battlefield
    attacking or blocking, the permanent does enter the battlefield but it's
    never considered to be an attacking or blocking permanent.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.3b - If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking
    under the control of any player except an attacking player, that creature
    does enter the battlefield, but it's never considered to be an attacking
    creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.3c - If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield blocking but
    the creature it would block isn't attacking either the first creature's
    controller or a planeswalker that player controls, that creature does
    enter the battlefield, but it's never considered to be a blocking
    creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.4 - A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if
    its controller changes, if an effect specifically removes it from combat,
    if it's a planeswalker that's being attacked and stops being a
    planeswalker, or if it's an attacking or blocking creature that
    regenerates (see Rule 701.11) or stops being a creature.  A creature
    that's removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked,
    and/or unblocked creature.  A planeswalker that's removed from combat
    stops being attacked. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.4a - Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking
    creature, spells or abilities that would have kept that creature from
    attacking or blocking don't remove the creature from combat.
  506.4b - Tapping or untapping a creature that's already been declared as an
    attacker or blocker doesn't remove it from combat and doesn't prevent its
    combat damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.4c - If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, removing that
    planeswalker from combat doesn't remove that creature from combat.  It
    continues to be an attacking creature, although it is attacking neither a
    player nor a planeswalker.  It may be blocked.  If it is unblocked, it
    will deal no combat damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.4d - A permanent that's both a blocking creature and a planeswalker
    that's being attacked is partially removed from combat if it stops being
    either a creature or a planeswalker (but not both).  It's not removed from
    the portion of combat that's relevant to the card type it still is.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  506.5 - A creature attacks alone if it's the only creature declared as an
    attacker during the declare attackers step.  A creature is attacking alone
    if it's attacking but no other creatures are.  A creature blocks alone if
    it's the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers
    step.  A creature is blocking alone if it's blocking but no other
    creatures are. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

507 - Beginning of Combat Step
  507.1 - First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the
    active player's opponent's don't all automatically become defending
    players, the active player chooses one of his or her opponents.  That
    player becomes the defending player.  This turn-based action doesn't use
    the stack.  (See Rule 506.2.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  507.2 - Second, any abilities that trigger at the beginning of combat go on
    the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  507.3 - Third, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells and
    activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

508 - Declare Attackers Step
  508.1 - First, the active player declares attackers.  This turn-based action
    doesn't use the stack.  To declare attackers, the active player follows
    the steps below, in order.  If at any point during the declaration of
    attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps
    listed below, the declaration was illegal; the game returns to the moment
    before the declaration (see Rule 714, "Handling Illegal Actions").
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1a - The active player chooses which creatures that he or she controls,
    if any, will attack.  The chosen creatures must be untapped, and each one
    must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player
    continuously since the turn began. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1b - If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, or the game
    allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active
    player announces which player or planeswalker each of the chosen creatures
    is attacking. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1c - The active player checks each creature he or she controls to see
    whether it's affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature
    can't attack, or that it can't attack unless some condition is met).  If
    any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is
    illegal. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that
    states "<This creature> can't attack alone."  It's legal to declare both
    as attackers. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1d - The active player checks each creature he or she controls to see
    whether it's affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature
    must attack, or that it must attack if some condition is met).  If the
    number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum
    possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying
    any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal.  Tapped
    creatures and creatures with unpaid costs to attack are exempt from
    effects that would require them to attack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls two creatures: one that "attacks if able" and
    one with no abilities.  An effect states, "No more than one creature can
    attack each turn."  The only legal attack is for just the creature
    that "attacks if able" to attack.  It's illegal to attack with the other
    creature, attack with both, or attack with neither. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1e - If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a "bands with other"
    ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded
    with which.  (See Rule 702.19, "Banding.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1f - The active player taps the chosen creatures.  Tapping a creature
    when it's declared as an attacker isn't a cost; attacking simply causes
    creatures to become tapped. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1g - If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, the
    active player determines the total cost to attack.  Costs may include
    paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards,
    and so on.  Once the total cost is determined, it becomes "locked in."  If
    effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1h - If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a
    chance to activate mana abilities (see Rule 605, "Mana Abilities").
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1i - Once the player has enough mana in his or her mana pool, he or she
    pays all costs in any order.  Partial payments are not allowed.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.1j - Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes
    an attacking creature.  It remains an attacking creature until it's
    removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first.  See
    Rule 506.4. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.2 - Second, any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared go
    on the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.2a - Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the
    point the creature is declared as an attacker.  They will not trigger if a
    creature attacks and then that creature's characteristics change to match
    the ability's trigger condition. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A permanent has the ability "Whenever a green creature attacks,
    destroy that creature at end of combat."  If a blue creature attacks and
    is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.3 - Third, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells and
    activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.4 - Effects from a creature that refer to a defending player refer only
    to the defending player it's attacking (if it's attacking a player) or the
    controller of the planeswalker it's attacking (if it's attacking a
    planeswalker). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.5 - If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller
    chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player
    controls it's attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect
    that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it's attacking).  Such
    creatures are "attacking" but, for the purposes of trigger events and
    effects, they never "attacked." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  508.6 - If no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the
    battlefield attacking, skip the declare blockers and combat damage steps.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

509 - Declare Blockers Step
  509.1 - First, the defending player declares blockers.  This turn-based
    action doesn't use the stack.  To declare blockers, the defending player
    follows the steps below, in order.  If at any point during the declaration
    of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the
    steps listed below, the declaration was illegal; the game returns to the
    moment before the declaration (see Rule 714, "Handling Illegal Actions").
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1a - The defending player chooses which creatures that he or she
    controls, if any, will block.  The chosen creatures must be untapped.  For
    each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature
    for it to block that's attacking him, her, or a planeswalker he or she
    controls. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1b - The defending player checks each creature he or she controls to see
    whether it's affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature
    can't block, or that it can't block unless some condition is met).  If any
    restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    A restriction may be created by an evasion ability (a static ability an
    attacking creature has that restricts what can block it).  If an attacking
    creature gains or loses an evasion ability after a legal block has been
    declared, it doesn't affect that block.  Different evasion abilities are
    cumulative. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An attacking creature with flying and shadow can't be blocked by
    a creature with flying but without shadow. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1c - The defending player checks each creature he or she controls to see
    whether it's affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature
    must block, or that it must block if some condition is met).  If the
    number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum
    possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying
    any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal.  Tapped
    creatures and creatures with unpaid costs to block are exempt from effects
    that would require them to block. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls one creature that "blocks if able" and another
    creature with no abilities.  An effect states, "Creatures can't be blocked
    except by two or more creatures."  Having only the first creature block
    violates the restriction.  Having neither creature block fulfills the
    restriction but not the requirement.  Having both creatures block the same
    attacking creature fulfills both the restriction and the requirement, so
    that's the only option. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1d - If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the
    defending player determines the total cost to block.  Costs may include
    paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards,
    and so on.  Once the total cost is determined, it becomes "locked in."  If
    effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1e - If any of the costs require mana, the defending player then has a
    chance to activate mana abilities (see Rule 605, "Mana Abilities").
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.1f - Once the player has enough mana in his or her mana pool, he or she
    pays all costs in any order.  Partial payments are not allowed.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 509.1g - Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player
    becomes a blocking creature.  Each one is blocking the attacking creatures
    chosen for it.  It remains a blocking creature until it's removed from
    combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first.  See Rule 506.4.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 509.1h - An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as
    blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no creatures declared
    as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature.  This remains unchanged
    until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes
    blocked or unblocked, or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first.  A
    creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it are removed
    from combat. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 509.2 - Second, for each attacking creature that's become blocked by
    multiple creatures, the active player announces its damage assignment
    order among the blocking creatures.  This turn-based action doesn't use
    the stack.  (During the combat damage step, an attacking creature can't
    assign combat damage to a creature that's blocking it unless each creature
    ahead of that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Craw Wurm is blocked by Llanowar Elves, Runeclaw Bear,
    and Serra Angel.  The Craw Wurm's controller announces the Craw Wurm's
    damage assignment order as Serra Angel, then Runeclaw Bear, then Llanowar
    Elves. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 509.2a - During the declare blockers step, if a blocking creature is removed
    from combat or a spell or ability causes it to stop blocking an attacking
    creature, the blocking creature is removed from all relevant damage
    assignment orders.  The relative order among the remaining blocking
    creatures is unchanged. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  509.3 - Third, for each creature that's blocking multiple creatures (because
    some effect allows it to), the defending player announces its damage
    assignment order among the attacking creatures.  This turn-based action
    doesn't use the stack.  (During the combat damage step, a blocking
    creature can't assign combat damage to a creature it's blocking unless
    each creature ahead of that blocked creature in its order is assigned
    lethal damage.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 509.3a - During the declare blockers step, if an attacking creature is
    removed from combat or a spell or ability causes it to stop being blocked
    by a blocking creature, the attacking creature is removed from all
    relevant damage assignment orders.  The relative order among the remaining
    attacking creatures is unchanged. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  509.4 - Fourth, any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared go
    on the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.4a - An ability that reads "Whenever <this creature> blocks, ..."
    generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it
    blocks multiple creatures.  It triggers if the creature is declared as a
    blocker.  It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the
    result of an effect, but only if it wasn't a blocking creature at that
    time.  (See Rule 509.1g.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.4b - An ability that reads "Whenever <this creature> blocks a creature,
    ..." triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the
    ability blocks.  It triggers only if the creature is declared as a
    blocker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.4c - An ability that reads "Whenever <this creature> becomes blocked,
    ..." generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if
    it's blocked by multiple creatures.  It will trigger if that creature
    becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker.  It will
    also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a
    creature that's put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the
    attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time.  (See
    Rule 509.1h.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 509.4d - An ability that reads "Whenever <this creature> becomes blocked by
    a creature, ..." triggers once for each creature that blocks the named
    creature.  It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block
    the attacking creature, even if it had already been blocked that combat.
    It won't trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than
    a creature. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  509.4e - If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by
    a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature
    blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared.
    Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to
    trigger.  This applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or
    being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.4f - If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics
    blocks, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at
    the point blockers are declared.  If an ability triggers when a creature
    with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger only if the
    creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked
    creature.  If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a
    creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter
    creature has those characteristics at the point becomes a blocking
    creature.  None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creature's
    characteristics change to match the ability's trigger condition later on.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A creature has the ability "Whenever this creature becomes
    blocked by a white creature, destroy that creature at end of combat."  If
    the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned
    white, the ability will not trigger. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.4g - An ability that reads "Whenever <this creature> attacks and isn't
    blocked, ..." triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that
    creature.  It won't trigger if the attacking creature is blocked and then
    all its blockers are removed from combat. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  509.5. - Fifth, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 509.6. - If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block
    an attacking creature, the active player announces the blocking creature's
    placement in the attacking creature's damage assignment order.  The
    relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged.  Then
    the defending player announces the attacking creature's placement in the
    blocking creature's damage assignment order.  The relative order among the
    remaining attacking creatures is unchanged.  This is done as part of the
    blocking effect. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 509.7. - If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller
    chooses which attacking creature it's blocking as it enters the
    battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies
    what it's blocking), then the active player announces the new creature's
    placement in the blocked creature's damage assignment order.  The relative
    order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged.  A creature put
    onto the battlefield this way is "blocking" but, for the purposes of
    trigger events and effects, it never "blocked." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Lumengrid Warden is blocked by Runeclaw Bear.  The
    defending player casts Flash Foliage, which puts a Saproling token onto
    the battlefield blocking the Lumengrid Warden.  Lumengrid Warden's
    controller announces the Lumengrid Warden's damage assignment order as the
    Saproling token, then Runeclaw Bear. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

510 - Combat Damage Step
  510.1 - First, the active player announces how each attacking creature
    assigns its combat damage, then the defending player announces how each
    blocking creature assigns its combat damage.  This turn-based action
    doesn't use the stack.  A player assigns a creature's combat damage
    according to the following rules: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  510.1a - Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat
    damage equal to its power.  Creatures that would assign 0 or less damage
    this way don't assign combat damage at all. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  510.1b - An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player or
    planeswalker it's attacking.  If it isn't currently attacking
    anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left
    the battlefield), it assigns no combat damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 510.1c - A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures
    blocking it.  If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example,
    they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage.
    If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage
    to that creature.  If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns
    its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment
    order announced for it.  This may allow the blocked creature to divide its
    combat damage.  However, it can't assign combat damage to a creature
    that's blocking it unless each creature that precedes that blocking
    creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.  When checking for
    assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the
    creature and damage from other creatures that's being assigned during the
    same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might
    change the amount of damage that's actually dealt.  An amount of damage
    that's greater than a creature's lethal damage may be assigned to it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Craw Wurm (a 6/4
    creature) is Wall of Wood (a 0/3 creature) then Eager Cadet (a 1/1
    creature).  Craw Wurm can assign 3 damage to the Wall and 3 damage to the
    Cadet, 4 damage to the Wall and 2 damage to the Cadet, 5 damage to the
    Wall and 1 damage to the Cadet, or 6 damage to the Wall.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Craw Wurm (a 6/4
    creature) is Wall of Wood (a 0/3 creature) then Eager Cadet (a 1/1
    creature).  During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts
    Giant Growth targeting Wall of Wood, which gives it +3/+3 until end of
    turn.  Craw Wurm must assign its 6 damage to the Wall.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Craw Wurm (a 6/4
    creature) is Wall of Wood (a 0/3 creature) then Eager Cadet (a 1/1
    creature).  During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts
    Mending Hands targeting Wall of Wood, which prevents the next 4 damage
    that would be dealt to it.  Craw Wurm can assign 3 damage to the Wall
    and 3 damage to the Cadet, 4 damage to the Wall and 2 damage to the
    Cadet, 5 damage to the Wall and 1 damage to the Cadet, or 6 damage to the
    Wall. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking
    Enormous Baloth (a 7/7 creature) is Trained Armodon (a 3/3 creature)
    that already has 2 damage marked on it, then Foriysian Brigade (a 2/4
    creature that can block an additional creature), then
    Silverback Ape (a 5/5 creature).  The damage assignment order of an
    attacking Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian
    Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature).  Among other
    possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to
    the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade, and 5 damage to the Ape, and have
    the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  510.1d - A blocking creature assigns combat damage to the creatures it's
    blocking.  If it isn't currently blocking any creatures (if, for example,
    they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage.
    If it's blocking exactly one creature, it assigns all its combat damage to
    that creature.  If it's blocking two or more creatures, it assigns its
    combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order
    announced for it.  This may allow the blocking creature to divide its
    combat damage.  However, it can't assign combat damage to a creature that
    it's blocking unless each creature that precedes that blocked creature is
    assigned lethal damage.  When checking for assigned lethal damage, take
    into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other
    creatures that's being assigned during the same combat damage step, but
    not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that's
    actually dealt.  An amount of damage that's greater than a creature's
    lethal damage may be assigned to it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  510.1e - Each creature's damage must be assigned fully before another
    creature's damage may be assigned. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 510.1f - Once a player has assigned combat damage from each attacking or
    blocking creature he or she controls, the total damage assignment is
    checked to see if it complies with the above rules.  If it doesn't, the
    combat damage assignment was illegal; the game returns to the moment
    before that player began to assign combat damage.  (See
    Rule 714, "Handling Illegal Actions"). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  510.2 - Second, all combat damage that's been assigned is dealt
    simultaneously.  This turn-based action doesn't use the stack.  No player
    has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time
    combat damage is assigned and the time it's dealt.  This is a change from
    previous rules. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Suntail Hawk (a 1/1 creature with flying) and
    Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature) are attacking.  Mogg Fanatic (a 1/1
    creature with the ability "Sacrifice Mogg Fanatic: Mogg Fanatic deals 1
    damage to target creature or player) blocks the Goblin Piker.  The
    defending player sacrifices Mogg Fanatic during the declare blockers step
    to deal 1 damage to the Suntail Hawk.  The Hawk is destroyed.  The Piker
    deals and is dealt no combat damage this turn.  If the defending player
    instead left Mogg Fanatic on the battlefield, the Fanatic and the Piker
    would have dealt lethal damage to one another, but the Suntail Hawk
    couldn't have been dealt damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  510.3 - Third, any abilities that triggered on damage being assigned or
    dealt go on the stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  510.4 - Fourth, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 510.5 - If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see
    Rule 702.7) or double strike (see Rule 702.4) as the combat damage step
    begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are
    those with first strike or double strike.  After that step, instead of
    proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat
    damage step.  The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step
    are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor
    double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the
    remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike.  After
    that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

511 - End of Combat Step
  511.1 - First, all "at end of combat" abilities trigger and go on the
    stack.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  511.2 - Second, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 511.3 - As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures and
    planeswalkers (including those that are phased out) are removed from
    combat.  After the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and
    the postcombat main phase begins (see Rule 505). [CompRules 2009/10/01]

512 - Ending Phase
  512.1 - The ending phase consists of two steps: end and cleanup.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

513 - End Step
  513.1 - First, all abilities that trigger "at the beginning of the end step"
    or "at the beginning of the next end step" go on the stack.  (See
    Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  513.1a - For many years, abilities that trigger at the beginning of the end
    step were printed with the trigger condition "at end of turn."  Cards that
    were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card
    reference to say "at the beginning of the end step" or "at the beginning
    of the next end step." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  513.2 - Second, the active player gets priority.  Players may cast spells
    and activate abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 513.3 - If a permanent with an ability that triggers "at the beginning of
    the end step" enters the battlefield during this step, that ability won't
    trigger until the next turn's end step.  Likewise, if a delayed triggered
    ability that triggers "at the beginning of the next end step" is created
    during this step, that ability won't trigger until the next turn's end
    step.  In other words, the step doesn't "back up" so those abilities can
    go on the stack.  This rule applies only to triggered abilities; it
    doesn't apply to continuous effects whose durations say "until end of
    turn" or "this turn."  (See Rule 514, "Cleanup Step.")
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

514 - Cleanup Step
  514.1 - First, if the active player's hand contains more cards than his or
    her maximum hand size (normally seven), he or she discards enough cards to
    reduce his or her hand size to that number.  This turn-based action
    doesn't use the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  514.2 - Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage
    marked on permanents (including phased-out permanents) is removed and
    all "until end of turn" and "this turn" effects end.  This turn-based
    action doesn't use the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  514.3 - Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no
    spells can be cast and no abilities can be activated.  However, this rule
    is subject to the following exception: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 514.3a - At this point, the game checks to see if any state-based actions
    would be performed and/or any triggered abilities are waiting to be put
    onto the stack (including those that trigger "at the beginning of the next
    cleanup step").  If so, those state-based actions are performed, then
    those triggered abilities are put on the stack, then the active player
    gets priority.  Players may cast spells and activate abilities.  Once the
    stack is empty and all players pass in succession, another cleanup step
    begins. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

6 - Spells, Abilities, and Effects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

600 - General

601 - Casting Spells
  601.1 - For many years, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as
    a spell, was referred to on cards as "playing" that spell or that card.
    Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle
    card reference so they now refer to "casting" that spell or that card.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.1a - Some effects still refer to "playing" a card.  "Playing a card"
    means playing that card as a land or casting that card as a spell,
    whichever is appropriate. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2 - To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it's in (usually the
    hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually
    resolve and have its effect.  Casting a spell follows the steps listed
    below, in order.  If, at any point during the casting of a spell, a player
    is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the spell was cast
    illegally; the game returns to the moment before that spell started to be
    cast (see Rule 714, "Handling Illegal Actions").  Announcements and
    payments can't be altered after they've been made. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 601.2a - The player announces that he or she is casting the spell.  That
    card (or that copy of a card) moves from the zone it's in to the stack.
    It becomes the topmost object on the stack.  It has all the
    characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it,
    and that player becomes its controller.  The spell remains on the stack
    until it's countered or resolves. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  601.2b - If the spell is modal the player announces the mode choice (see
    Rule 700.2).  If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see
    Rule 702.44), he or she reveals those cards in his or her hand.  If the
    spell has alternative, additional, or other special costs that will be
    paid as it's being cast such as buyback, kicker, or convoke costs (see
    Rule 116.8 and Rule 116.9), the player announces his or her intentions to
    pay any or all of those costs (see Rule 601.2e).  A player can't apply two
    alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell.
    If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it's being
    cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see Rule 107.3), the player
    announces the value of that variable.  If a cost that will be paid as the
    spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the
    nonhybrid equivalent cost he or she intends to pay.  Previously made
    choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard
    or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the
    player's options when making these choices. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 601.2c - The player announces his or her choice of an appropriate player,
    object, or zone for each target the spell requires.  A spell may require
    some targets only if an alternative, additional, or special cost (such as
    a buyback or kicker cost), or a particular mode, was chosen for it;
    otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not have those targets.  If
    the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many
    targets he or she will choose before he or she announces those targets.
    The same target can't be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the
    word "target" on the spell.  However, if the spell uses the word "target"
    in multiple places, the same object, player, or zone can be chosen once
    for each instance of the word "target" (as long as it fits the targeting
    criteria).  If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as
    a target, the player chooses targets so that he or she obeys the maximum
    possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects
    that say that an object or player can't be chosen as a target.  The chosen
    players, objects, and/or zones each become a target of that spell.  (Any
    abilities that trigger when those players, objects, and/or zones become
    the target of a spell trigger at this point; they'll wait to be put on the
    stack until the spell has finished being cast.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: If a spell says "Tap two target creatures," then the same target
    can't be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets.  A
    spell that says "Destroy target artifact and target land," however, can
    target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word "target" in
    multiple places. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2d - If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an
    effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player
    announces the division.  Each of these targets must receive at least one
    of whatever is being divided. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2e - The player determines the total cost of the spell.  Usually this is
    just the mana cost.  Some spells have additional or alternative costs.
    Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other
    alternative costs.  Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents,
    sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on.  The total cost is
    the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in Rule 601.2b), plus all
    additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions.  If
    the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost
    reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}.  It can't be reduced to
    less than {0}.  Once the total cost is determined, any effects that
    directly affect the total cost are applied.  Then the resulting total cost
    becomes "locked in."  If effects would change the total cost after this
    time, they have no effect. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2f - If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a
    chance to activate mana abilities (see Rule 605, "Mana Abilities").  Mana
    abilities must be activated before costs are paid. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2g - The player pays the total cost in any order.  Partial payments are
    not allowed.  Unpayable costs can't be paid. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You cast Death Bomb, which costs {3}{B} and has an additional
    cost of sacrificing a creature.  You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar,
    whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast.  Because a
    spell's total cost is "locked in" before payments are actually made, you
    pay {2}{B}, not {3}{B}, even though you're sacrificing the Familiar.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.2h - Once the steps described in Rule 601.2a through Rule 601.2g are
    completed, the spell becomes cast.  Any abilities that trigger on a spell
    being cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time.  If the spell's
    controller had priority before casting it, he or she gets priority.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.3 - Some spells specify that one of their controller's opponents does
    something the controller would normally do while it's being cast, such as
    choose a mode or choose targets.  In these cases, the opponent does so
    when the spell's controller normally would do so. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.3a - If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice,
    the spell's controller decides which of those opponents will make the
    choice. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.3b - If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do
    something at the same time as the spell is being cast, the spell's
    controller goes first, then the other player.  This is an exception to
    Rule 101.4. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 601.4 - Casting a spell that alters costs won't affect spells and abilities
    that are already on the stack. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  601.5 - A player can't begin to cast a spell that's prohibited from being
    cast. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  601.5a - If an effect allows a card that's prohibited from being cast to be
    cast face down, and the face-down spell would not be prohibited, that
    spell can be cast face down.  See Rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and
    Permanents." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

602 - Activating Activated Abilities
+ 602.1 - Activated abilities have a cost and an effect.  They are written
    as "<Cost>: <Effect.> <Activation restriction (if any).>"  The activation
    cost is everything before the colon (:).  An ability's activation cost
    must be paid by the player who is activating it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The activation cost of an ability that reads "{2},{Tap}: You
    gain 1 life" is two mana of any type plus tapping the permanent that has
    the ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  602.1a - An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be
    activated.  If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without
    specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.1b - For many years, the action of using an activated ability was
    referred to on cards as "playing" that ability.  Cards that were printed
    with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they
    now refer to "activating" that ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.2 - To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its
    costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect.  Only an
    object's controller (or its owner, if it doesn't have a controller) can
    activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says
    otherwise.  Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in
    order.  If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is
    unable to comply with any of those steps, the ability was activated
    illegally; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to
    be activated (see Rule 714, "Handling Illegal Actions").  Announcements
    and payments can't be altered after they've been made.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 602.2a - The player announces that he or she is activating the ability.  If
    an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that
    has that ability is revealed.  That ability is created on the stack as an
    object that's not a card.  It becomes the topmost object on the stack.  It
    has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics.
    Its controller is the player who activated the ability.  The ability
    remains on the stack until it's countered or resolves.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  602.2b - The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical
    to the process for casting a spell listed in Rule 601.2b through
    Rule 601.2h.  Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they
    apply to casting a spell.  An activated ability's analog to a spell's mana
    cost (as referenced in Rule 601.2e) is its activation cost.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.3 - Some abilities specify that one of their controller's opponents does
    something the controller would normally do while it's being activated,
    such as choose a mode or choose targets.  In these cases, the opponent
    does so when the ability's controller normally would do so.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.3a - If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice,
    the ability's controller decides which of those opponents will make the
    choice. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.3b - If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do
    something at the same time as the ability is being activated, the
    ability's controller goes first, then the other player.  This is an
    exception to Rule 101.4. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 602.4 - Activating an ability that alters costs won't affect spells and
    abilities that are already on the stack. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  602.5 - A player can't begin to activate an ability that's prohibited from
    being activated. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.5a - A creature's activated ability with the tap symbol ({Tap}) or the
    untap symbol ({Untap}) in its activation cost can't be activated unless
    the creature has been under its controller's control since the start of
    his or her most recent turn.  Ignore this rule for creatures with
    haste (see Rule 702.10). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.5b - If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for
    example, "Activate this ability only once each turn"), the restriction
    continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.5c - If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on
    its use from another object, that restriction applies only to that ability
    as acquired from that object.  It doesn't apply to other, identically
    worded abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.5d - Activated abilities that read "Activate this ability only any time
    you could cast a sorcery" mean the player must follow the timing rules for
    casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isn't actually a sorcery.  The
    player doesn't actually need to have a sorcery card that he or she could
    cast. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  602.5e - Activated abilities that read "Activate this ability only any time
    you could cast an instant" mean the player must follow the timing rules
    for casting an instant spell, though the ability isn't actually an
    instant.  The player doesn't actually need to have an instant card that he
    or she could cast. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

603 - Handling Triggered Abilities
  603.1 - Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect.  They
    are written as "<Trigger condition>, <effect>," and begin with the
    word "when," "whenever," or "at."  They can also be expressed
    as "<When/Whenever/At> <trigger event>, <effect>." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2 - Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability's
    trigger event, that ability automatically triggers.  The ability doesn't
    do anything at this point. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2a - Because they aren't cast or activated, triggered abilities can
    trigger even when it isn't legal to cast spells and activate abilities.
    Effects that prevent abilities from being activated don't affect them.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2b - When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger "at the
    beginning of" that phase or step trigger. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2c - An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs.
    However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple
    occurrences.  See also Rule 509.4. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition
    reads, "Whenever a land is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, ...
    ."  If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will
    trigger once for each land put into the graveyard during the spell's
    resolution. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2d - Some trigger events use the word "becomes" (for example, "becomes
    tapped" or "becomes blocked").  These trigger only at the time the named
    event happens--they don't trigger if that state already exists or
    retrigger if it persists.  Similarly, they don't trigger if an object
    enters a zone in that state. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability that triggers when a permanent "becomes tapped"
    triggers only when the status of a permanent that's already on the
    battlefield changes from untapped to tapped. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2e - If a triggered ability's trigger condition is met, but the object
    with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the
    ability does not trigger. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.2f - An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs.  An
    event that's prevented or replaced won't trigger anything.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won't trigger if
    all the damage is prevented. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 603.3 - Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack
    as an object that's not a card the next time a player would receive
    priority.  See Rule 115, "Timing and Priority."  The ability becomes the
    topmost object on the stack.  It has the text of the ability that created
    it, and no other characteristics.  It remains on the stack until it's
    countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  603.3a - A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its
    source at the time it triggered, unless it's a delayed triggered ability.
    The controller of a delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled
    the spell or ability that created it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.3b - If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player
    received priority, each player, in APNAP order, puts triggered abilities
    he or she controls on the stack in any order he or she chooses.  (See
    Rule 101.4.)  Then the game once again checks for and resolve state-based
    actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during
    this process go on the stack.  This process repeats until no new
    state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger.  Then the
    appropriate player gets priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.3c - If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode
    choice when he or she puts the ability on the stack.  If one of the modes
    would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for
    example), that mode can't be chosen.  If no mode can be chosen, the
    ability is removed from the stack.  (See Rule 700.2.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.3d - The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the
    stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in
    Rule 601.2c through Rule 601.2d.  If a choice is required when the
    triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for
    it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability
    illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.4 - A triggered ability may read "When/Whenever/At <trigger event>, if
    <condition>, <effect>."  When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks
    whether the stated condition is true.  The ability triggers only if it is;
    otherwise it does nothing.  If the ability triggers, it checks the stated
    condition again as it resolves.  If the condition isn't true at that time,
    the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing.  Note that this
    mirrors the check for legal targets.  This rule is referred to as
    the "intervening 'if' clause" rule.  (The word "if" has only its normal
    English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only
    applies to an "if" that immediately follows a trigger condition.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.5 - Some triggered abilities' effects are optional (they contain "may,"
    as in "At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card").  These
    abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their
    controller intends to exercise the ability's option or not.  The choice is
    made when the ability resolves.  Likewise, triggered abilities that have
    an effect "unless" something is true or a player chooses to do something
    will go on the stack normally; the "unless" part of the ability is dealt
    with when the ability resolves. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6 - Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are
    called "zone-change triggers."  Many abilities with zone-change triggers
    attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones.  During
    resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved
    to.  If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part
    of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do
    anything.  The ability could be unable to find the object because the
    object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before
    the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a
    player, such as a library or an opponent's hand.  (This rule applies even
    if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability
    resolves.)  The most common zone-change triggers are
    enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6a - Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters
    the battlefield.  These are written, "When <this object> enters the
    battlefield, ..." or "Whenever a <type> enters the battlefield, ..."  Each
    time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all
    permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for
    any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6b - Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so
    the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then).  The
    permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics.
    Continuous effects don't apply before the permanent is on the battlefield,
    however (see Rule 603.6e). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If an effect reads "All lands are creatures" and a land card is
    played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it
    enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a
    creature enters the battlefield.  Conversely, if an effect reads "All
    creatures lose all abilities" and a creature card with an
    enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that
    effect will cause it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the
    battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability won't trigger.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6c - Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves
    from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves
    the game because its owner leaves the game.  These are written as, but
    aren't limited to, "When <this object> leaves the battlefield, ..."
    or "Whenever <something> is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, ...
    ."  An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the
    battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to.  An
    ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone "from
    anywhere" is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an
    object is put into that zone from the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 603.6d - Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked
    to see if the event matched any trigger conditions.  Continuous effects
    that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions
    are and what the objects involved in the event look like.  However, some
    triggered abilities must be treated specially because the object with the
    ability may no longer be on the battlefield, may have moved to a hand or
    library, or may no longer be controlled by the appropriate player.  The
    game has to "look back in time" to determine if these abilities trigger.
    Leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a permanent
    phases out, abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see
    is put into a hand or library, abilities that trigger specifically when an
    object becomes unattached, abilities that trigger when a player loses
    control of an object, and abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks
    away from a plane will trigger based on their existence, and the
    appearance of objects, prior to the event rather than afterward.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that
    has the ability "Whenever a creature is put into a graveyard from the
    battlefield, you gain 1 life."  Someone plays a spell that destroys all
    artifacts, creatures, and enchantments.  The artifact's ability triggers
    twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner's graveyard at the same
    time as the creatures. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6e - Some permanents have text that reads "<This permanent> enters the
    battlefield with ...," "As <this permanent> enters the battlefield
    ...," "<This permanent> enters the battlefield as ...," or "<This
    permanent> enters the battlefield tapped."  Such text is a static
    ability--not a triggered ability--whose effect occurs as part of the event
    that puts the permanent onto the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.6f - Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted
    permanent leaving the battlefield.  These triggered abilities can find the
    new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can
    also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner's graveyard
    after state-based actions have been checked.  See Rule 400.7.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.7 - An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do
    something at a later time.  A delayed triggered ability will
    contain "when," "whenever," or "at," although that word won't usually
    begin the ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.7a - Delayed triggered abilities come from spells or other abilities
    that create them on resolution.  That means a delayed triggered ability
    won't trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger
    event occurred just beforehand.  Other events that happen earlier may make
    the trigger event impossible. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Part of an effect reads "When this creature leaves the
    battlefield," but the creature in question leaves the battlefield before
    the spell or ability creating the effect resolves.  In this case, the
    delayed ability never triggers. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If an effect reads "When this creature becomes untapped" and the
    named creature becomes untapped before the effect resolves, the ability
    waits for the next time that creature untaps. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.7b - A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once--the next time
    its trigger event occurs--unless it has a stated duration, such as "this
    turn." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.7c - A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object
    still affects it even if the object changes characteristics.  However, if
    that object is no longer in the zone it's expected to be in at the time
    the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won't affect
    it.  (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it's a
    new object and thus won't be affected.  See Rule 400.7.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability that reads "Exile this creature at the beginning of
    the next end step" will exile the permanent even if it's no longer a
    creature during the next end step.  However, it won't do anything if the
    permanent left the battlefield before then. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.7d - The source of a delayed triggered ability created by a spell is
    that spell.  The source of a delayed triggered ability created by another
    ability is the same as the source of that other ability.  The controller
    of a delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of the spell
    or ability that created it, even if that player no longer controls its
    source. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  603.8 - Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player
    controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than
    triggering when an event occurs.  These abilities trigger as soon as the
    game state matches the condition.  They'll go onto the stack at the next
    available opportunity.  These are called state triggers.  (Note that state
    triggers aren't the same as state-based actions.)  A state-triggered
    ability doesn't trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been
    countered, or has otherwise left the stack.  Then, if the object with the
    ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its
    trigger condition, the ability will trigger again. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A permanent's ability reads, "Whenever you have no cards in hand,
    draw a card."  If its controller plays the last card from his or her hand,
    the ability will trigger once and won't trigger again until it has
    resolved.  If its controller casts a spell that reads "Discard your hand,
    then draw that many cards," the ability will trigger during the spell's
    resolution because the player's hand was momentarily empty.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 603.9 - Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses
    the game.  These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game,
    regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result
    of a draw.  See Rule 104.3. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  603.10 - Some objects have a static ability that's linked to a triggered
    ability.  (See Rule 607, "Linked Abilities.")  These objects combine both
    abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by
    the triggered ability.  A very few objects have triggered abilities which
    are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability,
    rather than at the beginning. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An ability that reads "Reveal the first card you draw each turn.
    Whenever you reveal a basic land card this way, draw a card" is a static
    ability linked to a triggered ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

604 - Handling Static Abilities
  604.1 - Static abilities do something all the time rather than being
    activated or triggered.  They are written as statements, and they're
    simply true. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.2 - Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are
    prevention effects or replacement effects.  These effects are active as
    long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has
    the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the
    appropriate zone, as described in Rule 112.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.3 - Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities.  A
    characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an object's
    characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that
    object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box).
    Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones.  They also
    function outside the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.3a - A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets
    the following criteria: (1) It defines an object's colors, subtypes,
    power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was
    granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or
    it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or
    text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the characteristics
    of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to
    itself; and (5) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if
    certain conditions are met. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.4 - Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that
    modify the object they're attached to, but those abilities don't target
    that object.  If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a
    different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and
    starts modifying the new one. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.5 - Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack.  These
    are often abilities that refer to countering the spell.  Also, abilities
    that say "As an additional cost to cast ...," "You may pay <cost> rather
    than pay <this object>'s mana cost," and "You may cast <this object>
    without paying its mana cost" work while a spell is on the stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.6 - Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you
    could cast or play it from (usually your hand).  These are limited to
    those that read, "You may <cast/play> <this card> ...," "You can't
    <cast/play> <this card> ...," and "<Cast/Play> <this card> only ... ."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  604.7 - Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can't
    use an object's last known information for purposes of determining how
    their effects are applied. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

605 - Mana Abilities
  605.1 - Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana
    abilities, which are subject to special rules.  Only abilities that meet
    either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities,
    regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing
    restrictions (such as "Activate this ability only any time you could cast
    an instant") they may have. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.1a - An activated ability without a target that could put mana into a
    player's mana pool when it resolves is a mana ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.1b - A triggered ability without a target that triggers from activating
    a mana ability and could put mana into a player's mana pool when it
    resolves is a mana ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.2 - A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn't
    allow it to produce mana. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A permanent has an ability that reads "{Tap}: Add {G} to your
    mana pool for each creature you control."  This is still a mana ability
    even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.3 - Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for
    activating any other activated ability (see Rule 602.2), with the
    following exceptions: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.3a - A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever he or she
    has priority, whenever he or she is casting a spell or activating an
    ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks
    for a mana payment, even if it's in the middle of casting or resolving a
    spell or activating or resolving an ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.3b - An activated mana ability doesn't go on the stack, so it can't be
    targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to.  Rather, it resolves
    immediately after it is activated.  (See Rule 405.6c.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.4 - Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered
    abilities (see Rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities"), with the
    following exception: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.4a - A triggered mana ability doesn't go on the stack, so it can't be
    targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to.  Rather, it resolves
    immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for
    priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An enchantment reads, "Whenever a player taps a land for mana,
    that player adds one mana of that type to his or her mana pool."  If a
    player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is
    added to the player's mana pool immediately and can be used to pay for the
    spell. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.5 - Abilities that don't meet the criteria specified in Rule 605.1a and
    Rule 605.1b and spells aren't mana abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.5a - An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could
    put mana into a player's mana pool when it resolves.  The same is true for
    a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event
    other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers
    from activating a mana ability but couldn't produce mana.  These follow
    the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  605.5b - A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into
    a player's mana pool when it resolves.  It's cast and resolves just like
    any other spell.  Some older cards were printed with the card type "mana
    source"; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and
    are now instants. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

606 - Loyalty Abilities
+ 606.1 - Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to
    special rules. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 606.2 - An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty
    ability.  Normally, only planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 606.3 - A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent he or she
    controls any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a
    main phase of his or her turn, but only if none of its loyalty abilities
    have been activated that turn. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 606.4 - The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on
    or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as
    shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability's cost. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 606.5 - A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost can't be activated
    unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

607 - Linked Abilities
+ 607.1 - An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them
    causes actions to be taken or objects to be affected and the other one
    directly refers to those actions or objects.  If so, these two abilities
    are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects
    that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.1a - An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants
    that ability to that object is still considered to be "printed on" that
    object for these purposes. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2 - There are different kinds of linked abilities.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2a - If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it
    that exiles one or more cards, and another ability printed on it that
    refers either to "the exiled cards" or to cards "exiled with <this
    object>," these abilities are linked.  The second ability refers only to
    cards in the exile zone that were put there as a result of the first
    ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2b - If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a
    replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and
    another ability printed on it that refers either to "the exiled cards" or
    to cards "exiled with <this object>," these abilities are linked.  The
    second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there
    as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability.
    See Rule 614, "Replacement Effects." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2c - If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it
    that puts one or more objects onto the battlefield, and another ability
    printed on it that refers to objects "put onto the battlefield with <this
    object>," those abilities are linked.  The second can refer only to
    objects put onto the battlefield as a result of the first.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2d - If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player
    to "choose a <value>" or "name a card," and another ability printed on it
    that refers to "the chosen <value>," "the last chosen <value>," or "the
    named card," these abilities are linked.  The second ability refers only
    to a choice made as a result of the first ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2e - If an object has both a static ability and a triggered ability
    printed on it in the same paragraph, those abilities are linked.  The
    triggered ability refers only to actions taken as a result of the static
    ability.  See Rule 603.10. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2f - If an object has a kicker ability printed on it, and another
    ability printed on it that refers to whether that object was kicked, those
    abilities are linked.  The second refers only to whether the intent to pay
    the kicker cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as
    a spell.  If a kicker ability lists multiple costs, it will have multiple
    abilities linked to it.  Each of those abilities will specify which kicker
    cost it refers to.  See Rule 702.30, "Kicker." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.2g - The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked
    abilities.  See Rule 702.69, "Champion." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.3 - An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: "As Paradise
    Plume enters the battlefield, choose a color," "Whenever a player casts a
    spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life," and "{Tap}: Add one mana
    of the chosen color to your mana pool."  The first and second abilities
    are linked.  The first and third abilities are linked.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 607.4 - If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same
    effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that
    object even though they weren't printed on that object.  They can't be
    linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object
    may currently have or may have had in the past. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Arc-Slogger has the ability "{R}: Exile the top ten cards of
    your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2 damage to target creature or player."
    Sisters of Stone Death has the ability "{B}{G}: Exile target creature
    blocking or blocked by Sisters of Stone Death" and the ability "{2}{B}:
    Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone Death onto the
    battlefield under your control." Quicksilver Elemental has the
    ability "{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of
    target creature until end of turn."  If a player has Quicksilver Elemental
    gain Arc-Slogger's ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental
    gain Sisters of Stone Death's abilities, activates the exile ability, and
    then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only the creature
    card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Death's ability
    can be returned to the battlefield.  Creature cards Quicksilver Elemental
    exiled with Arc-Slogger's ability can't be returned.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

608 - Resolving Spells and Abilities
+ 608.1 - Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on
    top of the stack resolves.  (See Rule 609, "Effects.")
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2 - If the object that's resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell,
    or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps.  The steps
    described in Rule 608.2a and Rule 608.2b are followed first.  The steps
    described in Rule 608.2c through Rule 608.2i are then followed as
    appropriate, in no specific order.  The step described in Rule 608.2j is
    followed last. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2a - If a triggered ability has an intervening "if" clause, it checks
    whether the clause's condition is true.  If it isn't, the ability is
    removed from the stack and does nothing.  Otherwise, it continues to
    resolve.  See Rule 603.4. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2b - If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the
    targets are still legal.  A target that's no longer in the zone it was in
    when it was targeted is illegal.  Other changes to the game state may
    cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may
    have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell.  If the
    source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known
    information is used during this process.  The spell or ability is
    countered if all its targets, for every instance of the word "target," are
    now illegal.  If the spell or ability is not countered, it will resolve
    normally, affecting only the targets that are still legal.  If a target is
    illegal, the spell or ability can't perform any actions on it or make the
    target perform any actions. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Aura Blast is a white instant that reads, "Destroy target
    enchantment.  Draw a card."  If the enchantment isn't a legal target
    during Aura Blast's resolution (say, if it has gained protection from
    white or left the battlefield), then Aura Blast is countered.  Its
    controller doesn't draw a card. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Plague Spores reads, "Destroy target nonblack creature and
    target land.  They can't be regenerated."  Suppose the same animated land
    is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of
    the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves.
    Plagues Spores isn't countered because the black creature land is still a
    legal target for the "target land" part of the spell.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 608.2c - The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in
    the order written.  However, replacement effects may modify these actions.
    In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier
    text (for example, "Destroy target creature.  It can't be regenerated"
    or "Counter target spell.  If that spell is countered this way, put it on
    top of its owner's library instead of into its owner's graveyard.")  Don't
    just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases--read the
    whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2d - If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than
    choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability,
    or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player
    announces these while applying the effect.  The player can't choose an
    option that's illegal or impossible, with the exception that having an
    empty library doesn't make drawing a card an impossible action (see
    Rule 119.3). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A spell's instruction reads, "You may sacrifice a creature.  If
    you don't, you lose 4 life."  A player who controls no creatures can't
    choose the sacrifice option. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 608.2e - Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted
    by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players.  In these
    cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then
    the first action is processed simultaneously.  Then the choices for the
    second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed
    simultaneously, and so on.  See Rule 101.4. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2f - If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, he or she may
    activate mana abilities before taking that action.  If an effect
    specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during
    resolution, he or she does so by putting that spell on top of the stack,
    then continuing to cast it by following the steps in Rule 601.2a through
    Rule 601.2h, except no player receives priority after it's cast.  The
    currently resolving spell or ability then continues to resolve, which may
    include casting other spells this way.  No other spells can normally be
    cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2g - If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number
    of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when
    the effect is applied.  If the effect requires information from a specific
    object, including the source of the ability itself or a target that's
    become illegal, the effect uses the current information of that object if
    it's in the zone it was expected to be in; otherwise, the effect uses the
    object's last known information.  See Rule 112.7a.  (Note that if an
    effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a
    player chooses among some number of creatures or players, the amount and
    division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack
    rather than at this time; see Rule 601.2d).  If the ability text states
    that an object does something, it's the object as it exists--or as it most
    recently existed--that does it, not the ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2h - If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for
    the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones
    an object may also have. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: An effect that reads "Destroy all black creatures" destroys a
    white-and-black creature, but one that reads "Destroy all nonblack
    creatures" doesn't. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 608.2i - If an ability's effect refers to a specific untargeted object that
    has been previously referred to by that ability's cost or trigger
    condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed
    characteristics. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Wall of Tears says "Whenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature,
    return that creature to its owner's hand at end of combat."  If Wall of
    Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before
    the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to
    its owner's hand. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 608.2j - If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally
    resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to
    resolve fully. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.2k - As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell's resolution, the
    spell is put into its owner's graveyard.  As the final part of an
    ability's resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to
    exist. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.3 - If the object that's resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution
    involves a single step (unless it's an Aura).  The spell card becomes a
    permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell's
    controller. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.3a - If the object that's resolving is an Aura spell, its resolution
    involves two steps.  First, it checks whether the target specified by its
    enchant ability is still legal, as described in Rule 608.2b.  (See
    Rule 702.5, "Enchant.")  If so, the spell card becomes a permanent and is
    put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell's controller
    attached to the object it was targeting. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 608.3b - If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can't put it onto
    the battlefield, that player puts it into its owner's graveyard.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Worms of the Earth says "If a land would enter the
    battlefield, instead it doesn't."  Clone says "You may have Clone enter
    the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield."  If a
    player casts Clone and chooses to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature)
    while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone can't enter the
    battlefield from the stack.  It's put into its owner's graveyard.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

609 - Effects
+ 609.1 - An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a
    spell or ability.  When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability
    resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects.
    Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects.  Text itself
    is never an effect. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.2 - Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction's text
    states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more
    other zones. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: An effect that changes all lands into creatures won't alter land
    cards in players' graveyards.  But an effect that says spells cost more to
    cast will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always on
    the stack while a player is casting it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 609.3 - If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as
    much as possible. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: If a player is holding only one card, an effect that
    reads "Discard two cards" causes him or her to discard only that card.  If
    an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves
    as many as possible. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 609.4 - Some effects state that a player may do something "as though" some
    condition were true or a creature can do something "as though" some
    condition were true.  This applies only to the stated effect.  For
    purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition
    were true.  For all other purposes, treat the game normally.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.4a - If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the
    same thing "as though" different conditions were true, both conditions
    could apply.  If one "as though" effect satisfies the requirements for
    another "as though" effect, then both effects will apply.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A player controls Vedalken Orrery, an artifact that says "You
    may cast nonland cards as though they had flash."  That player casts
    Shaman's Trance, an instant that says, in part, "You may play cards
    from other players' graveyards as though they were in your graveyard." The
    player may cast a sorcery with flashback from another player's graveyard
    as though it were in that player's graveyard and as though it had flash.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 609.5 - If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability
    that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie.
    The Magic game has no default for ties. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.6 - Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention
    effects.  See Rule 614 and Rule 615. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.7 - Some effects apply to damage from a source--for example, "The next
    time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn,
    prevent that damage." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.7a - If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, he or
    she may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent
    spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement
    or prevention effect that's waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered
    ability that's waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the
    zone it used to be in); or, for certain casual variant games, a face-up
    card in the command zone.  A source doesn't need to be capable of dealing
    damage to be a legal choice.  The source is chosen when the effect is
    created.  If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the
    next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it's combat
    damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability.  If the player
    chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by
    that spell and any damage dealt by the permanent that spell becomes when
    it resolves. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.7b - Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace
    damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a
    source of a particular color.  When the source would deal damage,
    the "shield" rechecks the source's properties.  If the properties no
    longer match, the damage isn't prevented or replaced.  If for any reason
    the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn't used
    up. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 609.7c - Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from
    sources with certain properties.  For these effects, the prevention or
    replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and
    to any sources that aren't on the battlefield that have that property.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

610 - One-Shot Effects
+ 610.1 - A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn't have a
    duration.  Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent,
    putting a token onto the battlefield, and moving an object from one zone
    to another. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 610.2 - Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which
    instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a
    specific time) rather than as the spell or ability that's creating the
    one-shot effect resolves.  See Rule 603.7. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

611 - Continuous Effects
+ 611.1 - A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies
    control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a
    fixed or indefinite period. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.2 - A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.2a - A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such
    as "until end of turn").  If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end
    of the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.2b - Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability have durations worded "for as long as ... ."  If the "for as long
    as" duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would
    first be applied, the effect does nothing.  It doesn't start and
    immediately stop again, and it doesn't last forever.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Endoskeleton is an artifact with an activated ability that
    reads "{2},{Tap}: Target creature gets +0/+3 for as long as Endoskeleton
    remains tapped."  If you activate this ability and then Endoskeleton
    becomes untapped before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its
    duration--remaining tapped--was over before the effect began.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 611.2c - If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any
    objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous
    effect begins.  After that point, the set won't change.  (Note that this
    works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.)  A
    continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that
    doesn't modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects
    modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren't
    affected when that continuous effect began. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An effect that reads "All white creatures get +1/+1 until end of
    turn" gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the
    spell or ability resolves--even if they change color later--and doesn't
    affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: An effect that reads "Prevent all damage creatures would deal
    this turn" doesn't modify any object's characteristics, so it's modifying
    the rules of the game.  That means the effect will apply even to damage
    from creatures that weren't on the battlefield when the continuous effect
    began.  It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later
    in the turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 611.2d - If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect
    contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined
    only once, on resolution.  See Rule 608.2g. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.3 - A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an
    object. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.3a - A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn't "locked
    in"; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 611.3b - The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is
    on the battlefield or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A permanent with the static ability "All white creatures
    get +1/+1" generates an effect that continuously gives +1/+1 to each white
    creature on the battlefield.  If a creature becomes white, it gets this
    bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 611.3c - Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so
    simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield.  They don't
    wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it.
    Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they
    are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability
    to trigger when it enters the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A permanent with the static ability "All white creatures
    get +1/+1" is on the battlefield.  A creature spell that would normally
    create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature.  The
    creature doesn't enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

612 - Text-Changing Effects
+ 612.1 - Some continuous effects change an object's text.  This can apply to
    any words or symbols printed on that object, but generally affects only
    that object's rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the text
    that appears in its type line.  Such an effect is a text-changing effect.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 612.2 - A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the
    correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a
    land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a
    creature type).  An effect that changes a color word or a subtype can't
    change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of
    letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or
    creature type. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 612.2a - Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature
    types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens.  A
    text-changing effect that affects such a spell or an object with such an
    ability can change these words because they're being used as creature
    types, even though they're also being used as names.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 612.3 - Effects that add or remove abilities don't change the text of the
    objects they affect, so any abilities that are granted to an object can't
    be modified by text-changing effects that affect that object.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 612.4 - A token's subtypes and rules text are defined by the spell or
    ability that created the token.  A text-changing effect that affects a
    token can change these characteristics. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 612.5 - One card (Volrath's Shapeshifter) states that an object has
    the "full text" of another object.  This changes not just the text that
    appears in the object's text box and type line, but also changes the text
    that represents its name, mana cost, expansion symbol, power, and
    toughness. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

613 - Interaction of Continuous Effects
+ 613.1 - The values of an object's characteristics are determined by starting
    with the actual object.  For a card, that means the values of the
    characteristics printed on that card.  For a token or a copy of a spell or
    card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect
    that created it.  Then all applicable continuous effects are applied in a
    series of layers in the following order: [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1a - Layer 1: Copy effects are applied.  See Rule 706, "Copying
    Objects." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1b - Layer 2: Control-changing effects are applied.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1c - Layer 3: Text-changing effects are applied.  See
    Rule 612, "Text-Changing Effects." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1d - Layer 4: Type-changing effects are applied.  This includes effects
    that change an object's card type, subtype, and/or supertype.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1e - Layer 5: Color-changing effects are applied. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1f - Layer 6: Ability-adding and ability-removing effects are applied.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.1g - Layer 7: Power- and/or toughness-changing effects are applied.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.2 - Within layers 1-6, apply effects from characteristic-defining
    abilities first (see Rule 604.3), then all other effects in timestamp
    order (see Rule 613.6).  Note that dependency may alter the order in which
    effects are applied within a layer or sublayer.  (See Rule 613.7.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3 - Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order
    described below.  Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp
    order.  (See Rule 613.6.)  Note that dependency may alter the order in
    which effects are applied within a layer or sublayer.  (See Rule 613.7.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3a - Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities are
    applied.  See Rule 604.3. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3b - Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific
    number or value are applied. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3c - Layer 7c: Effects that modify power and/or toughness (but don't set
    power and/or toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3d - Layer 7d: Power and/or toughness changes from counters are applied.
    See Rule 120. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.3e - Layer 7e: Effects that switch a creature's power and toughness are
    applied.  Such effects take the value of power and apply it to the
    creature's toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the
    creature's power. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect.  Then another effect
    switches the creature's power and toughness.  Its new power and toughness
    is 4/1.  A new effect gives the creature +5/+0.  Its "unswitched" power
    and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual power and toughness is 4/6.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect.  Then another effect
    switches the creature's power and toughness.  Its new power and toughness
    is 4/1.  If the +0/+1 effect ends before the switch effect ends, the
    creature becomes 3/1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 613.4 - The application of continuous effects as described by the layer
    system is continually and automatically performed by the game.  All
    resulting changes to an object's characteristics are instantaneous.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Crusade is an enchantment that reads "White creatures
    get +1/+1."  Crusade and a 2/2 black creature are on the battlefield.  If
    an effect then turns the creature white (layer 5), it gets +1/+1 from
    Crusade (layer 7c), becoming 3/3.  If the creature's color is later
    changed to red (layer 5), Crusade's effect stops applying to it, and it
    will return to being 2/2. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is on the battlefield.  An effect
    puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 7d), making it 3/3.  A spell targeting
    it that says "Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn"
    resolves (layer 7c), making it 7/7.  An enchantment that says "Creatures
    you control get +0/+2" enters the battlefield (layer 7c), making it 7/9.
    An effect that says "Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn" is
    applied to it (layer 7b), making it 5/8 (0/1, plus +4/+4 from the resolved
    spell, plus +0/+2 from the enchantment, plus +1/+1 from the counter).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 613.5 - If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers,
    the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones.  If an
    effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to
    be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer
    and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed
    during this process. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: An effect that reads "Wild Mongrel gets +1/+1 and becomes the
    color of your choice until end of turn" is both a power- and
    toughness-changing effect and a color-changing effect.  The "becomes the
    color of your choice" part is applied in layer 5, and then
    the "gets +1/+1" part is applied in layer 7. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Grab the Reins has an effect that reads "Until end of turn,
    you gain control of target creature and it gains haste."  This is both a
    control-changing effect and an effect that adds an ability to an object.
    The "you gain control" part is applied in layer 2, and then the "it gains
    haste" part is applied in layer 6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An effect that reads "All noncreature artifacts become 2/2
    artifact creatures until end of turn" is both a type-changing effect and a
    power- and toughness-setting effect.  The type-changing effect is applied
    to all noncreature artifacts in layer 4 and the power- and
    toughness-setting effect is applied to those same permanents in layer 7,
    even though those permanents aren't noncreature artifacts by then.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is on the battlefield.  An effect
    that says "Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that's
    still a land" is applied to it (layers 4 and 7b).  An effect that
    says "Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn" is applied to
    it (layer 7c), making it a 4/4 land creature.  Then while you have ten
    creature cards in your graveyard, you activate Svogthos's ability: "Until
    end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant
    Zombie creature with 'This creature's power and toughness are each equal
    to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.' It's still a
    land."  (layers 4, 5, and 7b).  It becomes an 11/11 land creature.  If a
    creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos's power and
    toughness will be modified accordingly.  If the first effect is applied to
    it again, it will become a 4/4 land creature again. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 613.6 - Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are
    applied in is usually done using a timestamp system.  An effect with an
    earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6a - A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same
    timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the
    effect that created the ability, whichever is later.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6b - A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability receives a timestamp at the time it's created.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6c - An object's timestamp is the time it entered the zone it's
    currently in, unless it's an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that's
    attached to another object or player, or it's a face-up plane card.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6d - If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification becomes attached to an
    object or player, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new
    timestamp at that time. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6e - A face-up plane card receives a timestamp at the time it's turned
    face up. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6f - A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of
    the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.6g - If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously,
    such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached
    simultaneously, the active player determines their timestamp order at that
    time. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.7 - Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are
    applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system.  If a dependency
    exists, it will override the timestamp system. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.7a - An effect is said to "depend on" another if (a) it's applied in the
    same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect (see
    Rule 613.1 and Rule 613.3); (b) applying the other would change the text
    or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does
    to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a
    characteristic-defining ability.  Otherwise, the effect is considered to
    be independent of the other effect. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.7b - An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply
    until just after all of those effects have been applied.  If multiple
    dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they're applied
    in timestamp order relative to each other.  If several dependent effects
    form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the
    dependency loop are applied in timestamp order. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.8 - One continuous effect can override another.  Sometimes the results
    of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another
    effect does. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Two Auras are enchanting the same creature: one that
    says "Enchanted creature gains flying" and one that says "Enchanted
    creature loses flying."  Neither of these depends on the other, since
    nothing changes what they affect or what they're doing to it.  Applying
    them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last "wins." It's
    irrelevant whether an effect is temporary (such as "Target creature loses
    flying until end of turn") or global (such as "All creatures lose
    flying"). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: One effect reads, "White creatures get +1/+1," and another
    reads, "Enchanted creature is white."  The enchanted creature gets +1/+1
    from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 613.9 - Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects.  For
    example, an effect might give a player protection from red.  All such
    effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objects'
    characteristics.  See also the rules for timestamp order and
    dependency (Rule 613.6 and Rule 613.7). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 613.10 - Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects.  For
    example, effects may modify a player's maximum hand size, or say that a
    creature is indestructible.  These effects are applied after all other
    continuous effects have been applied.  Continuous effects that affect the
    costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified
    in Rule 601.2e.  All other such effects are applied in timestamp order.
    See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (Rule 613.6 and
    Rule 613.7). [CompRules 2009/10/01]

614 - Replacement Effects
+ 614.1 - Some continuous effects are replacement effects.  Like prevention
    effects (see Rule 615), replacement effects apply continuously as events
    happen--they aren't locked in ahead of time.  Such effects watch for a
    particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace
    that event with a different event.  They act like "shields" around
    whatever they're affecting. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.1a - Effects that use the word "instead" are replacement effects.  Most
    replacement effects use the word "instead" to indicate what events will be
    replaced with other events. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.1b - Effects that use the word "skip" are replacement effects.  These
    replacement effects use the word "skip" to indicate what events, steps,
    phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.1c - Effects that read "<This permanent> enters the battlefield with
    ...," "As <this permanent> enters the battlefield ...," or "<This
    permanent> enters the battlefield as ..." are replacement effects.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.1d - Continuous effects that read "<This permanent> enters the
    battlefield ..." or "<Objects> enter the battlefield ..." are replacement
    effects. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.1e - Effects that read "As <this permanent> is turned face up ...," are
    replacement effects. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.2 - Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source.  See
    Rule 609.7. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.3 - There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating
    an ability that generates a replacement effect.  Such effects last until
    they're used up or their duration has expired. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.4 - Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event
    occurs--they can't "go back in time" and change something that's already
    happened.  Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast
    or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus
    resolve before that event would occur. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A player can activate an ability to regenerate a creature in
    response to a spell that would destroy it.  Once the spell resolves,
    though, it's too late to regenerate the creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 614.5 - A replacement effect doesn't invoke itself repeatedly and gets only
    one opportunity for each event. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that
    reads "If a creature you control would deal damage to a creature or
    player, it deals double that damage to that creature or player instead." A
    creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damage--not just 4, and
    not an infinite amount. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 614.6 - If an event is replaced, it never happens.  A modified event occurs
    instead, which may in turn trigger abilities.  Note that the modified
    event may contain instructions that can't be carried out, in which case
    the impossible instruction is simply ignored. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.7 - If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never
    happens, the replacement effect simply doesn't do anything.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.7a - If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all.
    Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source,
    or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or
    player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.8 - Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect.  The
    word "instead" doesn't appear on the card but is implicit in the
    definition of regeneration.  "Regenerate <permanent>" means "The next time
    <permanent> would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked
    on it and tap it.  If it's an attacking or blocking creature, remove it
    from combat."  Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still
    trigger even if the permanent regenerates.  See Rule 701.11.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.9 - Some effects replace damage dealt to one creature, planeswalker, or
    player with the same damage dealt to another creature, planeswalker, or
    player; such effects are called redirection effects.  If either creature
    or planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be
    redirected, or is no longer a creature or planeswalker when the damage
    would be redirected, the effect does nothing.  If damage would be
    redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does
    nothing. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.10 - An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or
    turn is a replacement effect.  "Skip <something>" is the same as "Instead
    of doing <something>, do nothing."  Once a step, phase, or turn has
    started, it can no longer be skipped--any skip effects will wait until the
    next occurrence. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.10a - Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won't
    happen.  Anything scheduled for the "next" occurrence of something waits
    for the first occurrence that isn't skipped.  If two effects each cause a
    player to skip his or her next occurrence, that player must skip the next
    two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while
    the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.10b - Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then
    take another action.  That action is considered to be the first thing that
    happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.11 - Some effects replace card draws.  These effects are applied even if
    no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected
    player's library. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.11a - If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all
    actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before
    resuming the sequence. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.11b - If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an
    additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional
    action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that
    replacement effect. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.12 - Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the
    battlefield.  (See Rule 614.1c and Rule 614.1d.)  Such effects may come
    from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed
    to a general subset of permanents that includes it).  They may also come
    from other sources.  To determine how and whether these replacement
    effects apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would
    exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that
    have already modified how it enters the battlefield, continuous effects
    generated by the resolution of spells or abilities that changed the
    permanent's characteristics on the stack (see Rule 400.7a), and continuous
    effects from the permanent's own static abilities, but ignoring continuous
    effects from any other source that would affect it. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Voice of All says "As Voice of All enters the battlefield,
    choose a color" and "Voice of All has protection from the chosen color."
    An effect creates a token that's a copy of Voice of All.  As that token is
    put onto the battlefield, its controller chooses a color for it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Yixlid Jailer says "Cards in graveyards have no abilities."
    Scarwood Treefolk says "Scarwood Treefolk enters the battlefield
    tapped."  A Scarwood Treefolk that's put onto the battlefield from a
    graveyard enters the battlefield tapped. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says "Permanents enter the
    battlefield tapped."  It will not affect itself, so Orb of Dreams enters
    the battlefield untapped. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 614.13 - An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a
    replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and
    another ability that refers either to "the exiled cards" or to
    cards "exiled with <this object>."  These abilities are linked: the second
    refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct
    result of the replacement event caused by the first.  If another object
    gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked
    on that object.  They can't be linked to any other ability, regardless of
    what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the
    past.  See Rule 607, "Linked Abilities." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 614.14 - Some replacement effects are not continuous effects.  Rather, they
    are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of
    that spell or ability's own effect(s).  Such effects are called
    self-replacement effects.  When applying replacement effects to an event,
    self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

615 - Prevention Effects
+ 615.1 - Some continuous effects are prevention effects.  Like replacement
    effects (see Rule 614), prevention effects apply continuously as events
    happen--they aren't locked in ahead of time.  Such effects watch for a
    damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the
    damage that would be dealt.  They act like "shields" around whatever
    they're affecting. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.1a - Effects that use the word "prevent" are prevention effects.
    Prevention effects use "prevent" to indicate what damage will not be
    dealt. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.2 - Many preventions effects apply to damage from a source.  See
    Rule 609.7. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.3 - There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating
    an ability that generates a prevention effect.  Such effects last until
    they're used up or their duration has expired. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.4 - Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event
    occurs--they can't "go back in time" and change something that's already
    happened.  Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast
    or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus
    resolve before that event would occur. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A player can activate an ability that prevents damage in response
    to a spell that would deal damage.  Once the spell resolves, though, it's
    too late to prevent the damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 615.5 - Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may
    refer to the amount of damage that was prevented.  The prevention takes
    place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the
    effect takes place immediately afterward. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.6 - If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens.  A
    modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger abilities.
    Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can't be
    carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.7 - Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability refer to a specific amount of damage--for example, "Prevent the
    next 3 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn."
    These work like shields.  Each 1 damage that would be dealt to
    the "shielded" creature or player is prevented.  Preventing 1 damage
    reduces the remaining shield by 1.  If damage would be dealt to the
    shielded creature or player by two or more applicable sources at the same
    time, the player or the controller of the creature chooses which damage
    the shield prevents.  Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining
    damage is dealt normally.  Such effects count only the amount of damage;
    the number of events or sources dealing it doesn't matter.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.8 - Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or
    ability refer to the next time a specific source would deal damage.  These
    effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless
    of how much damage that is.  Once an instance of damage from that source
    has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt
    by that source are dealt normally. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.9 - Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a
    specific amount of damage--for example, "If a source would deal damage to
    you, prevent 1 of that damage."  Such an effect prevents only the
    indicated amount of damage from any applicable damage event at any given
    time. It will apply separately to damage from other applicable events that
    would happen at the same tmie, or at a different time.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Daunting Defender says "If a source would deal damage to a
    Cleric creature you control, prevent 1 of that damage."  Pyroclasm
    says "Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature."  Pyroclasm will deal 1
    damage to each Cleric creature controlled by Daunting Defender's
    controller.  It will deal 2 damage to each other creature that player
    controls. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.10 - Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be
    dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures.  Such an effect creates
    a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability
    that generates that effect resolves. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says "{Tap}: Prevent the
    next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other
    creature that shares a color with it this turn."  When the ability
    resolves, it gives the target creature and each other creature on the
    battlefield that shares a color with it at that time a shield preventing
    the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it.  Changing creatures' colors
    after the ability resolves doesn't add or remove shields, and creatures
    that enter the battlefield later in the turn don't get the shield.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 615.11 - Some effects state that damage "can't be prevented."  If
    unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are
    still applied to it.  Those effects won't prevent any damage, but any
    additional effects they have will take place. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 615.11a - A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable
    damage event just once.  It won't invoke itself repeatedly trying to
    prevent that damage. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

616 - Interaction of Replacement and/or Prevention Effects
+ 616.1 - If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting
    to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected
    object's controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected
    player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below.  If two or
    more players have to make these choices at the same time, choices are made
    in APNAP order (see Rule 101.4). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 616.1a - If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects are
    self-replacement effects (see Rule 614.14), one of them must be chosen.
    If not, proceed to Rule 616.1b. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 616.1b - If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would modify
    under whose control an object would enter the battlefield, one of them
    must be chosen.  If not, proceed to Rule 616.1c. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 616.1c - Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be
    chosen. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 616.1d - Once the chosen effect has been applied, this process is
    repeated (taking into account only replacement or prevention effects that
    would now be applicable) until there are no more left to apply.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Two permanents are on the battlefield.  One is an enchantment
    that reads "If a card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, instead
    exile it," and the other is a creature that reads "If <this creature>
    would be put into a graveyard from the battlefield, instead shuffle it
    into its owner's library."  The controller of the creature that would be
    destroyed decides which replacement to apply first; the other does
    nothing. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 616.2 - A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event
    as the result of another replacement or prevention effect that modifies
    the event. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: One effect reads "If you would gain life, draw that many cards
    instead," and another reads "If you would draw a card, return a card from
    your graveyard to your hand instead."  Both effects combine (regardless of
    the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player
    puts a card from his or her graveyard into his or her hand.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

7 - Additional Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

700 - General
  700.1 - Anything that happens in a game is an event.  Multiple events may
    take place during the resolution of a spell or ability.  The text of
    triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event they're
    looking for.  One "happening" may be treated as a single event by one
    ability and as multiple events by another. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If an attacking creature is blocked by two defending creatures,
    this is one event for a triggered ability that reads "Whenever <this
    creature> becomes blocked" but two events for a triggered ability that
    reads "Whenever <this creature> becomes blocked by a creature."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.2 - A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options preceded
    by "Choose one --," "Choose two --," "Choose one or both --," or "<a
    specified player> chooses one --."  Each of those options is a mode.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.2a - The controller of a modal spell or activated ability chooses the
    mode(s) as part of casting that spell or activating that ability.  If one
    of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal
    targets, for example), that mode can't be chosen.  (See Rule 601.2b.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.2b - The controller of a modal triggered ability chooses the mode(s) as
    part of putting that ability on the stack.  If one of the modes would be
    illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that
    mode can't be chosen.  If no mode can be chosen, the ability is removed
    from the stack.  (See Rule 603.3c.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.2c - If a spell or ability targets one or more targets only if a
    particular mode is chosen for it, its controller will need to choose those
    targets only if he or she chose that mode.  Otherwise, the spell or
    ability is treated as though it did not have those targets.  (See
    Rule 601.2c.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 700.2d - Some spells and abilities specify that a player other than their
    controller chooses a mode for it.  In that case, the other player does so
    when the spell or ability's controller normally would do so.  If there is
    more than one other player who could make such a choice, the spell or
    ability's controller decides which of those players will make the choice.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  700.2e - Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting
    requirements for each mode.  Changing a spell or ability's target can't
    change its mode. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.2f - A copy of a modal spell or ability copies the mode(s) chosen for
    it.  The controller of the copy can't choose a different mode.  (See
    Rule 706.9.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.3 - Sometimes an effect will cause objects to be temporarily grouped
    into two or more piles. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.3a - Each object in a pile is still an individual object.  The pile is
    not an object. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.3b - Objects grouped into piles don't leave the zone they're currently
    in.  If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the
    graveyard must be maintained. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Fact or Fiction reads, "Reveal the top five cards of your
    library.  An opponent separates those cards into two piles.  Put one pile
    into your hand and the other into your graveyard."  While an opponent is
    separating the revealed cards into piles, they're still in their owner's
    library.  They don't leave the library until they're put into their
    owner's hand or graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.3c - A pile can contain zero or more objects. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.4 - If a permanent is indestructible, rules and effects can't destroy
    it.  (See Rule 701.6, "Destroy.")  Such permanents are not destroyed by
    lethal damage, and they ignore the lethal-damage state-based action (see
    Rule 704.5g).  Rules or effects may cause an indestructible permanent to
    be sacrificed, put into a graveyard, or exiled. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.4a - Although the text "<This permanent> is indestructible" is an
    ability, actually being indestructible is neither an ability nor a
    characteristic.  It's just something that's true about a permanent.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.5 - If an attacking creature is unblockable, no creature can legally
    block it.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")  Spells or abilities
    may still cause it to become blocked. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  700.5a - Although the text "<This permanent> is unblockable" is an ability,
    actually being unblockable is neither an ability nor a characteristic.
    It's just something that's true about a creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701 - Keyword Actions
  701.1 - Most actions described in a card's rules text use the standard
    English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are
    used whose meanings may not be clear.  These "keywords" are game terms;
    sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.2 - Activate
  701.2a - To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and
    pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect.
    Only an object's controller (or its owner, if it doesn't have a
    controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object
    specifically says otherwise.  A player may activate an ability if he or
    she has priority.  See Rule 602, "Activating Activated Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.3 - Attach
  701.3a - To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object means
    to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object.  If
    something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it's customary to
    place it so that it's physically touching the permanent.  An Aura,
    Equipment, or Fortification can't be attached to an object it couldn't
    enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.3b - If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification
    to the object it's already attached to, the effect does nothing.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.3c - Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield
    to a different object causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to
    receive a new timestamp. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.3d - To "unattach" an Equipment from a creature means to move it away
    from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not
    equipping anything.  It should no longer be physically touching any
    creature.  If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to
    something ceases to be attached to it, that counts as "becoming
    unattached"; this includes if that object and/or that Aura, Equipment, or
    Fortification leaves the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.4 - Cast
  701.4a - To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it's in (usually the
    hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually
    resolve and have its effect.  A player may cast a spell if he or she has
    priority.  See Rule 601, "Casting Spells." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.4b - To cast a card is to cast it as a spell. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.5 - Counter
  701.5a - To counter a spell or ability means to cancel it, removing it from
    the stack.  It doesn't resolve and none of its effects occur.  A countered
    spell is put into its owner's graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.5b - The player who cast a countered spell or activated a countered
    ability doesn't get a "refund" of any costs that were paid.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.6 - Destroy
  701.6a - To destroy a permanent, move it from the battlefield to its owner's
    graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.6b - The only ways a permanent can be destroyed are as a result of an
    effect that uses the word "destroy" or as a result of the state-based
    actions that check for lethal damage (see Rule 704.5g) or damage from a
    source with deathtouch (see Rule 704.5h).  If a permanent is put into its
    owner's graveyard for any other reason, it hasn't been "destroyed."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.6c - A regeneration effect replaces a destruction event.  See
    Rule 701.11, "Regenerate." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.7 - Discard
  701.7a - To discard a card, move it from its owner's hand to that player's
    graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.7b - By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the
    affected player to choose which card to discard.  Some effects, however,
    require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card is
    discarded. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.8 - Exchange
  701.8a - A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for
    example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its
    resolution.  When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange
    can't be completed, no part of the exchange occurs. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures
    but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the
    spell does nothing to the other creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.8b - When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents
    are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously
    gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player.
    If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player,
    the exchange effect does nothing. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.8c - When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the
    amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total.
    Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered
    abilities may trigger on them. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.8d - Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in
    one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and
    cards in a player's hand).  These spells and abilities work the same as
    other "exchange" spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards
    only if all the cards are owned by the same player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.8e - If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone,
    and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being
    attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that
    object. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.8f - If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two
    zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still
    exchanged. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.9 - Exile
  701.9a - To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is.
    See Rule 406, "Exile." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.10 - Play
  701.10a - To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone
    it's in (usually the hand).  A player may play a land if he or she has
    priority, it's the main phase of his or her turn, the stack is empty, and
    he or she hasn't yet played a land this turn.  Playing a land is a special
    action (see Rule 114), so it doesn't use the stack; it simply happens.
    Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability
    isn't the same as playing a land.  See Rule 305, "Lands."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.10b - To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that
    card as a spell, whichever is appropriate. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.10c - Some effects instruct a player to "play" with a certain aspect of
    the game changed, such as "Play with the top card of your library
    revealed."  "Play" in this sense means to play the Magic game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.10d - For many years, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card
    as a spell, was referred to on cards as "playing" that spell or that card.
    Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle
    card reference so they now refer to "casting" that spell or that card.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.10e - For many years, the action of using an activated ability was
    referred to on cards as "playing" that ability.  Cards that were printed
    with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they
    now refer to "activating" that ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.11 - Regenerate
  701.11a - If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a
    permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the
    next time it would be destroyed this turn.  In this case, "Regenerate
    <permanent>" means "The next time <permanent> would be destroyed this
    turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it.  If it's an
    attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.11b - If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it
    replaces destruction with an alternate effect each time that permanent
    would be destroyed.  In this case, "Regenerate <permanent>" means "Instead
    remove all damage marked on <permanent> and tap it.  If it's an attacking
    or blocking creature, remove it from combat." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 701.11c - Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield
    nor casting a spell that creates a regeneration shield is the same as
    regenerating a permanent.  Effects that say that a permanent can't be
    regenerated don't prevent such abilities from being activated or such
    spells from being cast; rather, they prevent regeneration shields from
    having any effect. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

701.12 - Reveal
  701.12a - To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time.
    If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long
    as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to.
    If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a
    card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is
    announced until it the time it leaves the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.12b - Revealing a card doesn't cause it to leave the zone it's in.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.13 - Sacrifice
  701.13a - To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the
    battlefield directly to its owner's graveyard.  A player can't sacrifice
    something that isn't a permanent, or something that's a permanent he or
    she doesn't control.  Sacrificing a permanent doesn't destroy it, so
    regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can't affect this
    action. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

701.14 - Search
  701.14a - To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that
    zone (even if it's a hidden zone) and find a card that matches the given
    description. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.14b - If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated
    quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player
    isn't required to find some or all of those cards even if they're present
    in that zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Splinter says "Exile target artifact.  Search its controller's
    graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as that
    artifact and exile them.  That player then shuffles his or her library." A
    player casts Splinter targeting Howling Mine (an artifact).  Howling
    Mine's controller has another Howling Mine in her graveyard and two more
    in her library.  Splinter's controller must find the Howling Mine in the
    graveyard, but may choose to find zero, one, or two of the Howling Mines
    in the library. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  701.14c - If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of
    cards, such as "a card" or "three cards," that player must find that many

    its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar
    deck off that planar deck and turn it face up. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 701.19c - A player may planeswalk as the result of the "planeswalking
    ability" (see Rule 309.6) or because the owner of the face-up plane card
    leaves the game (see Rule 901.9). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 701.19d - The plane card that's turned face up is the plane the player

702 - Keyword Abilities
  702.1 - Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card's rules
    text.  Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to
    define on the card.  In these cases, the object lists only the name of the

    strike (see Rule 702.7) or double strike as the combat damage step begins,
    the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with
    first strike or double strike.  After that step, instead of proceeding to
    the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step.  The
    only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining
    attackers and blockers that had neither first strike or double strike as
    the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and
    blockers that currently have double strike.  After that step, the phase
    proceeds to the end of combat step. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  702.4c - Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat
    damage step will stop it from assigning combat damage in the second combat
    damage step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 702.4d - Giving double strike to a creature with first strike after it has

702.5 - Enchant
  702.5a - Enchant is a static ability, written "Enchant <object or player>."
    The enchant ability restricts what an Aura spell can target and what an
    Aura can enchant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.5b - For more information on Auras, see Rule 303, "Enchantments."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

    its enchant abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.5d - Auras that can enchant a player can target and be attached to
    players.  Such Auras can't target permanents and can't be attached to
    permanents. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.6 - Equip

+ 702.7b - If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or
    double strike (see Rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only
    creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first
    strike or double strike.  After that step, instead of proceeding to the
    end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step.  The only
    creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining
    attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as
    the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and
    blockers that currently have double strike.  After that step, the phase
    proceeds to the end of combat step. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.7c - Giving first strike to a creature without it after combat damage
    has already been dealt in the first combat damage step won't prevent that
    creature from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.
    Removing first strike from a creature after it has already dealt combat
    damage in the first combat damage step won't allow it to also assign
    combat damage in the second combat damage step (unless the creature has
    double strike). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  702.7d - Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.8 - Flash
  702.8a - Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you
    could play the card it's on.  "Flash" means "You may play this card any

  702.11c - Multiple instances of intimidate on the same creature are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.12 - Landwalk
+ 702.12a - Landwalk is a generic term that appears within an object's rules
    text as "<type>walk," where <type> is usually a subtype, but can be the
    card type land, any land type, any supertype, or any combination thereof.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.12b - Landwalk is an evasion ability.  A creature with landwalk is
    unblockable as long as the defending player controls at least one land
    with the specified subtype (as in "islandwalk"), with the specified
    supertype (as in "legendary landwalk"), without the specified
    supertype (as in "nonbasic landwalk"), or with both the specified
    supertype and the specified subtype (as in "snow swampwalk").  (See
    Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  702.12c - If a player is allowed to choose any landwalk ability, that player
    chooses a landwalk ability that includes one land subtype and/or one
    supertype.  The chosen ability doesn't need to have been printed on a
    card. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.12d - Landwalk abilities don't "cancel" one another.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If a player controls a snow Forest, that player can't block an

    creature with snow forestwalk. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.12e - Multiple instances of the same kind of landwalk on the same
    creature are redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.13 - Lifelink
  702.13a - Lifelink is a static ability.  Damage dealt by a source with
    lifelink causes that source's controller, or its owner if it has no
    controller, to gain that much life (in addition to any other results that
    damage causes).  See Rule 118.3. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 702.13b - If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it
    to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it
    had lifelink. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.13c - The lifelink rules function no matter what zone an object with
    lifelink deals damage from. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

702.14 - Protection
  702.14a - Protection is a static ability, written "Protection from
    <quality>."  This quality is usually a color (as in "protection from
    black") but can be any characteristic value.  If the quality happens to be
    a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability
    specifies that the quality is a name.  If the quality is a card type,
    subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents
    with that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the
    battlefield that are of that card type, subtype, or supertype.  This is an
    exception to Rule 109.2. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14b - A permanent or player with protection can't be targeted by spells
    with the stated quality and can't be targeted by abilities from a source
    with the stated quality. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14c - A permanent or player with protection can't be enchanted by Auras
    that have the stated quality.  Such Auras attached to the permanent or
    player with protection will be put into their owners' graveyards as a
    state-based action.  (See Rule 704, "State-Based Actions.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14d - A permanent with protection can't be equipped by Equipment that
    have the stated quality or fortified by Fortifications that have the
    stated quality.  Such Equipment or Fortifications become unattached from
    that permanent as a state-based action, but remain on the
    battlefield.  (See Rule 704, "State-Based Actions.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14e - Any damage that would be dealt by sources that have the stated
    quality to a permanent or player with protection is prevented.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14f - Attacking creatures with protection can't be blocked by creatures
    that have the stated quality. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14g - "Protection from <quality A> and from <quality B>" is shorthand
    for "protection from <quality A>" and "protection from <quality B>"; it
    behaves as two separate protection abilities.  If an effect causes an
    object with such an ability to lose protection from <quality A>, for
    example, that object would still have protection from <quality B>.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14h - "Protection from all <characteristic>" is shorthand
    for "protection from <quality A>," "protection from <quality B>," and so
    on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it
    behaves as multiple separate protection abilities.  If an effect causes an
    object with such an ability to lose protection from <quality A>, for
    example, that object would still have protection from <quality B>,
    <quality C>, and so on. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14i - "Protection from everything" is a variant of the protection
    ability.  A permanent with protection from everything has protection from
    each object regardless of that object's characteristic values.  Such a
    permanent can't be targeted by spells or abilities, enchanted by Auras,
    equipped by Equipment, fortified by Fortifications, or blocked by
    creatures, and all damage that would be dealt to it is prevented.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.14j - Multiple instances of protection from the same quality on the same
    permanent or player are redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.15 - Reach
  702.15a - Reach is a static ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.15b - A creature with flying can't be blocked except by creatures with
    flying and/or reach.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step," and
    Rule 702.9, "Flying.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]

    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.16 - Shroud
  702.16a - Shroud is a static ability.  "Shroud" means "This permanent or
    player can't be the target of spells or abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.16b - Multiple instances of shroud on the same permanent or player are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.17 - Trample
  702.17a - Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning
    an attacking creature's combat damage.  The ability has no effect when a
    creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage.  (See
    Rule 510, "Combat Damage Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.17b - The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns
    damage to the creature(s) blocking it.  Once all those blocking creatures
    are assigned lethal damage, any remaining damage is assigned as its
    controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player or
    planeswalker the creature is attacking.  When checking for assigned lethal
    damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage
    from other creatures that's being assigned during the same combat damage
    step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of
    damage that's actually dealt.  The attacking creature's controller need
    not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case
    can't assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A 2/2 creature with an ability that enables it to block multiple
    attackers blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities a 3/3 with
    trample.  The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker
    and 1 damage from the second to the blocking creature, and 2 damage to the
    defending player from the creature with trample. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A 6/6 green creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature
    with protection from green.  The attacking creature's controller must
    assign at least 2 damage to the blocker, even though that damage will be
    prevented by the blocker's protection ability.  The attacking creature's
    controller can divide the rest of the damage as he or she chooses between
    the blocking creature and the defending player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.17c - If an attacking creature with trample is blocked, but there are no
    creatures blocking it when damage is assigned, all its damage is assigned
    to the player or planeswalker it's attacking. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.17d - If a creature with trample is attacking a planeswalker, none of
    its combat damage can be assigned to the defending player, even if that
    planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking
    creature could assign to that planeswalker exceeds its loyalty.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.17e - Multiple instances of trample on the same creature are redundant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.18 - Vigilance
  702.18a - Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the
    declare attackers step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.18b - Attacking doesn't cause creatures with vigilance to tap.  (See
    Rule 508, "Declare Attackers Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.18c - Multiple instances of vigilance on the same creature are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.19 - Banding
  702.19a - Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for combat.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19b - "Bands with other" is a special form of banding.  If an effect
    causes a permanent to lose banding, the permanent loses all "bands with
    other" abilities as well. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19c - As a player declares attackers, he or she may declare that one or
    more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature
    without banding (even if it has "bands with other") are all in a "band."
    He or she may also declare that one or more attacking <quality> creatures
    with "bands with other <quality>" and any number of other attacking
    <quality> creatures are all in a band.  A player may declare as many
    attacking bands as he or she wants, but each creature may be a member of
    only one of them.  (Defending players can't declare bands but may use
    banding in a different way; see Rule 702.19j.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19d - All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player or
    planeswalker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19e - Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest
    of combat, even if something later removes banding or "bands with other"
    from one or more of the creatures in the band. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19f - An attacking creature that's removed from combat is also removed
    from the band it was in. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19g - Banding doesn't cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor
    does it remove any abilities.  The attacking creatures in a band are
    separate permanents. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19h - If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other
    creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by
    that same blocking creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player attacks with a band consisting of a creature with flying
    and a creature with swampwalk.  The defending player, who controls a
    Swamp, can block the flying creature if able.  If he or she does, then the
    creature with swampwalk will also become blocked by the blocking
    creature(s). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19i - If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the
    entire band becomes blocked. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.19j - During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being
    blocked by a creature with banding, or by both a <quality> creature
    with "bands with other <quality>" and another <quality> creature, the
    defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking
    creature's damage is assigned.  That player can divide that creature's
    combat damage as he or she chooses among any number of creatures blocking
    it.  This is an exception to the procedure described in Rule 510.1c.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 702.19k - During the combat damage step, if a blocking creature is blocking
    a creature with banding, or both a <quality> creature with "bands with
    other <quality>" and another <quality> creature, the active player (rather
    than the defending player) chooses how the blocking creature's damage is
    assigned.  That player can divide that creature's combat damage as he or
    she chooses among any number of creatures it's blocking.  This is an
    exception to the procedure described in Rule 510.1d.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  702.19m - Multiple instances of banding on the same creature are redundant.
    Multiple instances of bands with other of the same kind on the same
    creature are redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.20 - Rampage
  702.20a - Rampage is a triggered ability.  "Rampage N" means "Whenever this
    creature becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn for each
    creature blocking it beyond the first."  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers
    Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.20b - The rampage bonus is calculated only once per combat, when the
    triggered ability resolves.  Adding or removing blockers later in combat
    won't change the bonus. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.20c - If a creature has multiple instances of rampage, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.21 - Cumulative Upkeep
  702.21a - Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an
    increasing cost on a permanent.  "Cumulative upkeep <cost>" means "At the
    beginning of your upkeep, put an age counter on this permanent.  Then you
    may pay <cost> for each age counter on it.  If you don't, sacrifice it."
    If <cost> has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately
    for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none
    of them is paid.  Partial payments aren't allowed. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A creature has "Cumulative upkeep {W} or {U}" and two age
    counters on it.  When its ability next triggers and resolves, the
    creature's controller puts an age counter on it and then may pay
    {W}{W}{W}, {W}{W}{U}, {W}{U}{U}, or {U}{U}{U} to keep the creature on the
    battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A creature has "Cumulative upkeep--Sacrifice a creature" and one
    age counter on it.  When its ability next triggers and resolves, its
    controller can't choose the same creature to sacrifice twice.  Either two
    different creatures must be sacrificed, or the creature with cumulative
    upkeep must be sacrificed. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.21b - If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each
    triggers separately.  However, the age counters are not connected to any
    particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total
    number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A creature has two instances of "Cumulative upkeep--Pay 1 life."
    The creature currently has no counters but both cumulative upkeep
    abilities trigger.  When the first ability resolves, the controller adds a
    counter and then chooses to pay 1 life.  When the second ability resolves,
    the controller adds another counter and then chooses to pay an
    additional 2 life. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.22 - Flanking
  702.22a - Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare
    blockers step.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")  "Flanking"
    means "Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without
    flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.22b - If a creature has multiple instances of flanking, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.23 - Phasing
  702.23a - Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap
    step.  During each player's untap step, before the active player untaps
    his or her permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player
    controls "phase out."  Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had
    phased out under that player's control "phase in." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23b - If a permanent phases out, its status changes to "phased out."
    Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out
    permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist.
    It can't affect or be affected by anything else in the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out.  You
    cast a spell that says "Draw a card for each creature you control."  You
    draw two cards. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You control a phased-out creature.  You cast Wrath of God,
    which says "Destroy all creatures.  They can't be regenerated."  The
    phased-out creature is not destroyed. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23c - If a permanent phases in, its status changes to "phased in."  The
    game once again treats it as though it exists. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23d - The phasing event doesn't actually cause a permanent to change
    zones or control, even though it's treated as though it's not on the
    battlefield and not under its controller's control while it's phased out.
    Zone-change triggers don't trigger when a permanent phases in or out.
    Counters remain on a permanent while it's phased out.  Effects that check
    a phased-in permanent's history won't treat the phasing event as having
    caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller's
    control. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23e - Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire
    while that permanent is phased out.  If so, they will no longer affect
    that permanent once it's phased in.  In particular, effects with "for as
    long as" durations that track that permanent (see Rule 611.2b) end when
    that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23f - When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or
    Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time.
    This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out "indirectly." An
    Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won't phase
    in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it's attached
    to. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23g - If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and
    indirectly, it just phases out indirectly. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23h - An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will
    phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it
    phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is
    still in the game.  If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases
    in unattached.  State-based actions apply as appropriate.  (See
    Rule 704.5n and Rule 704.5p.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23i - Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also
    leave the game.  This doesn't trigger zone-change triggers.  See
    Rule 800.4. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23j - Phased-out tokens cease to exist as a state-based action.  See
    Rule 704.5d. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23k - If an effect causes a player to skip his or her untap step, the
    phasing event simply doesn't occur that turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.23m - Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.24 - Buyback
  702.24a - Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries.  It represents two
    static abilities that function while the spell is on the stack.  "Buyback
    <cost>" means "You may pay an additional <cost> as you cast this spell"
    and "If the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its owner's hand
    instead of into that player's graveyard as it resolves."  Paying a spell's
    buyback cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in Rule 601.2b
    and Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.25 - Shadow
  702.25a - Shadow is an evasion ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.25b - A creature with shadow can't be blocked by creatures without
    shadow, and a creature without shadow can't be blocked by creatures with
    shadow.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.25c - Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.26 - Cycling
  702.26a - Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card
    with cycling is in a player's hand.  "Cycling <cost>" means "<Cost>,
    Discard this card: Draw a card." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.26b - Although the cycling ability can be activated only if the card is
    in a player's hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the
    battlefield and in all other zones.  Therefore objects with cycling will
    be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated
    abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.26c - Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they're
    cycled.  "When you cycle <this card>" means "When you discard <this card>
    to pay a cycling cost."  These abilities trigger from whatever zone the
    card winds up in after it's cycled. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.26d - Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability.  "<Type>cycling
    <cost>" means "<Cost>, Discard this card: Search your library for a <type>
    card, reveal it, and put it into your hand.  Then shuffle your library."
    This type is usually a subtype (as in "mountaincycling") but can be any
    card type, subtype, supertype, or combination thereof (as in "basic
    landcycling"). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.26e - Any cards that trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger
    when a card is discarded to pay a typecycling cost.  Any effect that stops
    players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards'
    typecycling abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.27 - Echo
  702.27a - Echo is a triggered ability.  "Echo <cost>" means "At the
    beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent came under your control since
    the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay <cost>."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.27b - Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an
    echo cost.  These cards have been given errata in the Oracle card
    reference; each one now has an echo cost equal to its mana cost.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.28 - Horsemanship
  702.28a - Horsemanship is an evasion ability that appeared in the Portal
    Three Kingdoms set. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.28b - A creature with horsemanship can't be blocked by creatures without
    horsemanship.  A creature with horsemanship can block a creature with or
    without horsemanship.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.28c - Multiple instances of horsemanship on the same creature are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.29 - Fading
  702.29a - Fading is a keyword that represents two abilities.  "Fading N"
    means "This permanent enters the battlefield with N fade counters on it"
    and "At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this
    permanent.  If you can't, sacrifice the permanent." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.30 - Kicker
  702.30a - Kicker is a static ability that functions while the spell is on
    the stack.  "Kicker <cost>" means "You may pay an additional <cost> as you
    cast this spell."  The phrase "Kicker <cost 1> and/or <cost 2>" means the
    same thing as "Kicker <cost 1>, kicker <cost 2>."  Paying a spell's kicker
    cost(s) follows the rules for paying additional costs in Rule 601.2b and
    Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 702.30b - If a spell's controller declares the intention to pay any of that
    spell's kicker costs, that spell has been "kicked."  See Rule 601.2b.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.30c - Objects with kicker have additional abilities that specify what
    happens if it was kicked.  These abilities are linked to the kicker
    abilities printed on that object: they can refer only to those specific
    kicker abilities.  See Rule 607, "Linked Abilities."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.30d - Objects with more than one kicker cost have abilities that each
    correspond to a specific kicker cost.  They contain the phrases "if it was
    kicked with its [A]
    kicker" and "if it was kicked with its [B]
    kicker," where A and B are
    the first and second kicker costs listed on the card, respectively.  Each
    of those abilities is linked to the appropriate kicker ability.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.30e - If part of a spell's ability has its effect only if that spell was
    kicked, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell's
    controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked.
    Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets.  See
    Rule 601.2c. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

702.31 - Flashback
  702.31a - Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries.  It represents
    two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player's
    graveyard and the other that functions while the card is on the
    stack.  "Flashback <cost>" means "You may cast this card from your
    graveyard by paying <cost> rather than paying its mana cost" and "If the
    flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere
    else any time it would leave the stack."  Casting a spell using its
    flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in
    Rule 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.32 - Madness
  702.32a - Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities.  The first is
    a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a
    player's hand.  The second is a triggered ability that functions when the
    first ability is applied.  "Madness <cost>" means "If a player would
    discard this card, that player discards it, but may exile it instead of
    putting it into his or her graveyard" and "When this card is exiled this
    way, its owner may cast it by paying <cost> rather than paying its mana
    cost.  If that player doesn't, he or she puts this card into his or her
    graveyard." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.32b - Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for
    paying alternative costs in Rules 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through
    Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.33 - Fear
  702.33a - Fear is an evasion ability. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.33b - A creature with fear can't be blocked except by artifact creatures
    and/or black creatures.  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.33c - Multiple instances of fear on the same creature are redundant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.34 - Morph
  702.34a - Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which
    you could play the card it's on, and the morph effect works any time the
    card is face down.  "Morph <cost>" means "You may cast this card as a 2/2
    face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, no expansion
    symbol, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana
    cost."  (See Rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.34b - To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down.  It
    becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card, with no text, no name, no subtypes,
    no expansion symbol, and no mana cost.  Any effects or prohibitions that
    would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the
    face-up card's characteristics) are applied to casting this card.  These
    values are the copiable values of that object's characteristics.  (See
    Rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects," and Rule 706, "Copying
    Objects.")  Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same
    characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost.  This follows
    the rules for paying alternative costs.  You can use morph to cast a card
    from any zone from which you could normally play it.  When the spell
    resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the
    spell had.  The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it
    is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.34c - You can't cast a card face down if it doesn't have morph.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.34d - If you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you
    control face up.  This is a special action; it doesn't use the stack (see
    Rule 114).  To do this, show all players what the permanent's morph cost
    would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face
    up.  (If the permanent wouldn't have a morph cost if it were face up, it
    can't be turned face up this way.)  The morph effect on it ends, and it
    regains its normal characteristics.  Any abilities relating to the
    permanent entering the battlefield don't trigger when it's turned face up
    and don't have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the
    battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.34e - See Rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents," for more
    information on how to cast cards with morph. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.35 - Amplify
  702.35a - Amplify is a static ability.  "Amplify N" means "As this object
    enters the battlefield, reveal any number of cards from your hand that
    share a creature type with it.  This permanent enters the battlefield with
    N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way.  You can't reveal
    this card or any other cards that are entering the battlefield at the same
    time as this card." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.35b - If a creature has multiple instances of amplify, each one works
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.36 - Provoke
  702.36a - Provoke is a triggered ability.  "Provoke" means "Whenever this
    creature attacks, you may choose to have target creature defending player
    controls block this creature this combat if able.  If you do, untap that
    creature." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.36b - If a creature has multiple instances of provoke, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.37 - Storm
  702.37a - Storm is a triggered ability that functions on the stack.  "Storm"
    means "When you cast this spell, put a copy of it onto the stack for each
    other spell that was cast before it this turn.  If the spell has any
    targets, you may choose new targets for any of the copies."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.37b - If a spell has multiple instances of storm, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.38 - Affinity
  702.38a - Affinity is a static ability that functions while the spell is on
    the stack.  "Affinity for <text>" means "This spell costs you {1} less to
    cast for each <text> you control." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.38b - The affinity ability reduces only the amount of generic mana a
    spell's controller has to pay; it doesn't reduce how much colored mana
    that player has to pay. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.38c - If a spell has multiple instances of affinity, each of them
    applies. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.39 - Entwine
  702.39a - Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see Rule 700.2) that
    functions while the spell is on the stack.  "Entwine <cost>" means "You
    may choose all modes of this spell instead of just one.  If you do, you
    pay an additional <cost>."  Using the entwine ability follows the rules
    for choosing modes and paying additional costs in Rule 601.2b and
    Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.39b - If the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes
    in the order written on the card when the spell resolves.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.40 - Modular
  702.40a - Modular represents both a static ability and a triggered
    ability.  "Modular N" means "This permanent enters the battlefield with
    N +1/+1 counters on it" and "When this permanent is put into a graveyard
    from the battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact
    creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.40b - If a creature has multiple instances of modular, each one works
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.41 - Sunburst
  702.41a - Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is
    entering the battlefield from the stack.  "Sunburst" means "If this object
    is entering the battlefield from the stack as a creature, it enters the
    battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to
    cast it.  If this object is entering the battlefield from the stack and
    isn't entering the battlefield as a creature, it enters the battlefield
    with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.41b - Sunburst applies only as the spell is resolving and only if one or
    more colored mana was spent on its costs.  Mana paid for additional or
    alternative costs applies. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.41c - Sunburst can also be used to set a variable number for another
    ability.  If the keyword is used in this way, it doesn't matter whether
    the ability is on a creature spell or on a noncreature spell.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The ability "Modular--Sunburst" means "This permanent enters the
    battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to
    cast it" and "When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the
    battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for
    each +1/+1 counter on this permanent." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.41d - If an object has multiple instances of sunburst, each one works
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.42 - Bushido
  702.42a - Bushido is a triggered ability. "Bushido N" means "Whenever this
    creature blocks or becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of
    turn."  (See Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.42b - If a creature has multiple instances of bushido, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.43 - Soulshift
  702.43a - Soulshift is a triggered ability.  "Soulshift N" means "When this
    permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may return
    target Spirit card with converted mana cost N or less from your graveyard
    to your hand." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.43b - If a permanent has multiple instances of soulshift, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.44 - Splice
  702.44a - Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your
    hand.  "Splice onto <subtype> <cost>" means "You may reveal this card from
    your hand as you cast a <subtype> spell.  If you do, copy this card's text
    box onto that spell and pay <cost> as an additional cost to cast that
    spell."  Paying a card's splice cost follows the rules for paying
    additional costs in Rule 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Since the card with splice remains in the player's hand, it can
    later be cast normally or spliced onto another spell.  It can even be
    discarded to pay a "discard a card" cost of the spell it's spliced onto.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.44b - You can't choose to use a splice ability if you can't make the
    required choices (targets, etc.) for that card's instructions.  You can't
    splice any one card onto the same spell more than once.  If you're
    splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and
    choose the order in which their instructions will be followed.  The
    instructions on the main spell have to be followed first.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.44c - The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the text
    boxes of each of the spliced cards.  The spell doesn't gain any other
    characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes,
    etc.) of the spliced cards.  Text copied onto the spell that refers to a
    card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the
    text was copied. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that
    reads, "Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to target creature or player."  Suppose
    Glacial Ray is spliced onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell.  The
    spell is still blue, and Reach Through Mists deals the damage.  This means
    that the ability can target a creature with protection from red and deal 2
    damage to that creature. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.44d - Choose targets for the added text normally (see Rule 601.2c).
    Note that a spell with one or more targets will be countered if all of its
    targets are illegal on resolution. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.44e - The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack (for
    example, when it's countered, it's exiled, or it resolves).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.45 - Offering
  702.45a - Offering is a static ability of a card that functions in any zone
    from which the card can be cast.  "<Subtype> offering" means "You may cast
    this card any time you could cast an instant by sacrificing a <subtype>
    permanent.  If you do, the total cost to cast this card is reduced by the
    sacrificed permanent's mana cost." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.45b - The permanent is sacrificed at the same time the spell is
    announced (see Rule 601.2a).  The total cost of the spell is reduced by
    the sacrificed permanent's mana cost (see Rule 601.2e).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.45c - Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent's mana cost reduces
    generic mana in the total cost to cast the card with offering.  Colored
    mana in the sacrificed permanent's mana cost reduces mana of the same
    color in the total cost to cast the card with offering.  Colored mana in
    the sacrificed permanent's mana cost that doesn't match colored mana in
    the colored mana cost of the card with offering, or is in excess of the
    card's colored mana cost, reduces that much generic mana in the total
    cost. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.46 - Ninjutsu
  702.46a - Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the
    card with ninjutsu is in a player's hand.  "Ninjutsu <cost>"
    means "<Cost>, Reveal this card from your hand, Return an unblocked
    creature you control to its owner's hand: Put this card onto the
    battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.46b - The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability
    is announced until the ability leaves the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.46c - A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the
    battlefield is unblocked (see Rule 509.1h).  The creature with ninjutsu is
    put onto the battlefield unblocked.  It will be attacking the same player
    or planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its owner's hand.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.47 - Epic
  702.47a - Epic represents both a static ability and a delayed triggered
    ability.  "Epic" means "For the rest of the game, you can't cast spells,"
    and "At the beginning of each of your upkeeps for the rest of the game,
    copy this spell except for its epic ability.  If the spell has any
    targets, you may choose new targets for the copy."  See Rule 706.9.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.47b - A player can't cast spells once a spell with epic he or she
    controls resolves, but effects (such as the epic ability itself) can still
    put copies of spells onto the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.48 - Convoke
  702.48a - Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell is on
    the stack.  "Convoke" means "As an additional cost to cast this spell, you
    may tap any number of untapped creatures you control.  Each creature
    tapped this way reduces the cost to cast this spell by {1} or by one mana
    of any of that creature's colors."  Using the convoke ability follows the
    rules for paying additional costs in Rule 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through
    Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You cast Guardian of Vitu-Ghazi, a spell with convoke that
    costs {6}{G}{W}.  You announce that you're going to tap a colorless
    creature, a red creature, and a green-and-white creature to help pay for
    it.  The colorless creature and the red creature each reduce the spell's
    cost by {1}.  You choose whether the green-white creature reduces the
    spell's cost by {1}, {G}, or {W}.  Then the creatures become tapped as you
    pay Guardian of Vitu-Ghazi's cost. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.48b - Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.49 - Dredge
  702.49a - Dredge is a static ability that functions only while the card with
    dredge is in a player's graveyard.  "Dredge N" means "As long as you have
    at least N cards in your library, if you would draw a card, you may
    instead put N cards from the top of your library into your graveyard and
    return this card from your graveyard to your hand." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.49b - A player with fewer cards in his or her library than the number
    required by a dredge ability can't put any of them into his or her
    graveyard this way. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.50 - Transmute
  702.50a - Transmute is an activated ability that functions only while the
    card with transmute is in a player's hand.  "Transmute <cost>"
    means "<Cost>, Discard this card: Search your library for a card with the
    same converted mana cost as the discarded card, reveal that card, and put
    it into your hand.  Then shuffle your library.  Activate this ability only
    any time you could cast a sorcery." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.50b - Although the transmute ability can be activated only if the card
    is in a player's hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the
    battlefield and in all other zones.  Therefore objects with transmute will
    be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated
    abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.51 - Bloodthirst
  702.51a - Bloodthirst is a static ability.  "Bloodthirst N" means "If an
    opponent was dealt damage this turn, this permanent enters the battlefield
    with N +1/+1 counters on it." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.51b - "Bloodthirst X" is a special form of bloodthirst. "Bloodthirst X"
    means "This permanent enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it,
    where X is the total damage your opponents have been dealt this turn."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.51c - If an object has multiple instances of bloodthirst, each applies
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.52 - Haunt
  702.52a - Haunt is a triggered ability. "Haunt" on a permanent means "When
    this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, exile it
    haunting target creature."  "Haunt" on an instant or sorcery spell
    means "When this spell is put into a graveyard during its resolution,
    exile it haunting target creature." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.52b - Cards that are in the exile zone as the result of a haunt
    ability "haunt" the creature targeted by that ability.  The
    phrase "creature it haunts" refers to the object targeted by the haunt
    ability, regardless of whether or not that object is still a creature.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.52c - Triggered abilities of cards with haunt that refer to the haunted
    creature can trigger in the exile zone. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.53 - Replicate
  702.53a - Replicate is a keyword that represents two abilities.  The first
    is a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack.  The
    second is a triggered ability that functions while the spell is on the
    stack.  "Replicate <cost>" means "As an additional cost to cast this
    spell, you may pay <cost> any number of times" and "When you cast this
    spell, if a replicate cost was paid for it, copy it for each time its
    replicate cost was paid.  If the spell has any targets, you may choose new
    targets for any number of the copies."  Paying a spell's replicate cost
    follows the rules for paying additional costs in Rule 601.2b and
    Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.53b - If a spell has multiple instances of replicate, each is paid
    separately and triggers based on the payments made for it, not any other
    instance of replicate. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.54 - Forecast
  702.54a - A forecast ability is a special kind of activated ability that can
    be activated only from a player's hand.  It's written "Forecast --
    <Activated ability>." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.54b - A forecast ability may be activated only during the upkeep step of
    the card's owner and only once each turn.  The controller of the forecast
    ability reveals the card with that ability from his or her hand as the
    ability is activated.  That player plays with that card revealed in his or
    her hand until it leaves the player's hand or until a step or phase that
    isn't an upkeep step begins, whichever comes first. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.55 - Graft
  702.55a - Graft represents both a static ability and a triggered
    ability.  "Graft N" means "This permanent enters the battlefield with
    N +1/+1 counters on it" and "Whenever another creature enters the
    battlefield, if this permanent has a +1/+1 counter on it, you may move
    a +1/+1 counter from this permanent onto that creature."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.55b - If a creature has multiple instances of graft, each one works
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.56 - Recover
  702.56a - Recover is a triggered ability that functions only while the card
    with recover is in a player's graveyard.  "Recover <cost>" means "When a
    creature is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, you may pay
    <cost>.  If you do, return this card from your graveyard to your hand.
    Otherwise, exile this card." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.57 - Ripple
  702.57a - Ripple is a triggered ability that functions only while the card
    with ripple is on the stack.  "Ripple N" means "When you cast this spell,
    you may reveal the top N cards of your library, or, if there are fewer
    than N cards in your library, you may reveal all the cards in your
    library.  If you reveal cards from your library this way, you may cast any
    of those cards with the same name as this spell without paying their mana
    costs, then put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your
    library in any order." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.57b - If a spell has multiple instances of ripple, each triggers

    spell with split second is on the stack.  "Split second" means "As long as
    this spell is on the stack, players can't cast other spells or activate
    abilities that aren't mana abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.58b - Players may activate mana abilities and take special actions while
    a spell with split second is on the stack.  Triggered abilities trigger
    and are put on the stack as normal while a spell with split second is on
    the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.58c - Multiple instances of split second on the same spell are
    redundant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.59 - Suspend
  702.59a - Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities.  The first
    is a static ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a
    player's hand.  The second and third are triggered abilities that function
    in the exile zone.  "Suspend N--<cost>" means "If you could begin to cast
    this card by putting it onto the stack from your hand, you may pay <cost>
    and exile it with N time counters on it.  This action doesn't use the
    stack," and "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended,
    remove a time counter from it," and "When the last time counter is removed
    from this card, if it's exiled, play it without paying its mana cost if
    able.  If you can't, it remains exiled.  If you cast a creature spell this
    way, it gains haste until you lose control of the spell or the permanent
    it becomes." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.59b - A card is "suspended" if it's in the exile zone, has suspend, and
    has a time counter on it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.59c - Casting a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the
    rules for paying alternative costs in Rule 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through
    Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.60 - Vanishing
  702.60a - Vanishing is a keyword that represents three
    abilities.  "Vanishing N" means "This permanent enters the battlefield
    with N time counters on it," "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this

    and "When the last time counter is removed from this permanent, sacrifice
    it." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.60b - Vanishing without a number means "At the beginning of your upkeep,
    if this permanent has a time counter on it, remove a time counter from it"
    and "When the last time counter is removed from this permanent, sacrifice
    it." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.60c - If a permanent has multiple instances of vanishing, each works

    <cost>" means "<Cost>: You may exchange this permanent with an Aura card
    in your hand." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.62b - If either half of the exchange can't be completed, the ability has
    no effect. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You activate the aura swap ability of an Aura.  The only Aura
    card in your hand can't enchant the permanent that's enchanted by the Aura
    with aura swap.  The ability has no effect. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You activate the aura swap ability of an Aura that you control
    but you don't own.  The ability has no effect. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.63 - Delve
  702.63a - Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell that has
    it is on the stack.  "Delve" means "As an additional cost to cast this

702.71 - Evoke
  702.71a - Evoke represents two abilities: a static ability that functions in
    any zone from which the card can be cast and a triggered ability that
    functions on the battlefield.  "Evoke <cost>" means "You may cast this
    card by paying <cost> rather than paying its mana cost" and "When this
    permanent enters the battlefield, if its evoke cost was paid, its

    means "<Cost>, Discard this card: Put N +1/+1 counters on target
    creature." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.74b - Although the reinforce ability can be activated only if the card
    is in a player's hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the
    battlefield and in all other zones.  Therefore objects with reinforce will

    many -1/-1 counters to be put on that creature.  See Rule 118.3.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 702.77b - If a permanent leaves the battlefield before an effect causes it

    using its retrace ability follows the rules for paying additional costs in
    Rule 601.2b and Rule 601.2e through Rule 601.2g. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.79 - Devour
  702.79a - Devour is a static ability.  "Devour N" means "As this object
    enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of creatures.  This
    permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it for each
    creature sacrificed this way." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.79b - Some objects have abilities that refer to the number of creatures
    the permanent devoured.  "It devoured" means "sacrificed as a result of
    its devour ability as it entered the battlefield." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.80 - Exalted
  702.80a - Exalted is a triggered ability.  "Exalted" means "Whenever a
    creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of
    turn." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.80b - A creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as
    an attacker in a given combat phase.  See Rule 506.5.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.81 - Unearth
  702.81a - Unearth is an activated ability that functions while the card is
    in a graveyard.  "Unearth <cost>" means "<Cost>: Return this card from
    your graveyard to the battlefield.  It gains haste.  Exile it at the
    beginning of the next end step.  If it would leave the battlefield, exile
    it instead of putting it anywhere else.  Activate this ability only any
    time you could cast a sorcery." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

702.82 - Cascade
  702.82a - Cascade is a triggered ability that functions only while the spell
    with cascade is on the stack.  "Cascade" means "When you cast this spell,
    exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card
    whose converted mana cost is less than this spell's converted mana cost.
    You may cast that card without paying its mana cost.  Then put all cards
    exiled from the game this way that weren't cast on the bottom of your
    library in a random order." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  702.82b - If a spell has multiple instances of cascade, each triggers
    separately. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

703 - Turn-Based Actions
  703.1 - Turn-based actions are game actions that happen automatically when
    certain steps or phases begin, or when each step and phase ends.
    Turn-based actions don't use the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.1a - Abilities that watch for a specified step or phase to begin are
    triggered abilities, not turn-based actions.  (See Rule 603, "Handling
    Triggered Abilities.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.2 - Turn-based actions are not controlled by any player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.3 - Whenever a step or phase begins, if it's a step or phase that has
    any turn-based action associated with it, those turn-based actions are
    automatically dealt with first.  This happens before state-based actions
    are checked, before triggered abilities are put on the stack, and before
    players receive priority. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4 - The turn-based actions are as follows: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4a - Immediately after the untap step begins, all phased-in permanents
    with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out
    permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase
    in.  This all happens simultaneously.  See Rule 502.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4b - Immediately after the phasing action has been completed during the
    untap step, the active player determines which permanents he or she
    controls will untap.  Then he or she untaps them all simultaneously.  See
    Rule 502.2. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4c - Immediately after the draw step begins, the active player draws a
    card.  See Rule 504.1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4d - Immediately after the beginning of combat step begins, if the game
    being played is a multiplayer game in which the active player's opponent's
    don't all automatically become defending players, the active player
    chooses one of his or her opponents.  That player becomes the defending
    player.  See Rule 507.1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4e - Immediately after the declare attackers step begins, the active
    player declares attackers.  See Rule 508.1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4f - Immediately after the declare blockers step begins, the defending
    player declares blockers.  See Rule 509.1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4g - Immediately after blockers have been declared during the declare
    blockers step, for each attacking creature that's become blocked by
    multiple creatures, the active player announces the damage assignment
    order among the blocking creatures.  See Rule 509.2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4h - Immediately after the active player has announced damage assignment
    orders (if necessary) during the declare blockers step, for each creature
    that's blocking multiple creatures, the defending player announces the
    damage assignment order among the attacking creatures.  See Rule 509.3.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4i - Immediately after the combat damage step begins, each player in
    APNAP order announces how each attacking or blocking creature he or she
    controls assigns its combat damage.  See Rule 510.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4j - Immediately after combat damage has been assigned during the combat
    damage step, all combat damage is dealt simultaneously.  See Rule 510.2.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4k - Immediately after the cleanup step begins, if the active player's
    hand contains more cards than his or her maximum hand size (normally
    seven), he or she discards enough cards to reduce his or her hand size to
    that number.  See Rule 514.1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  703.4m - Immediately after the active player has discarded cards (if
    necessary) during the cleanup step, all damage is removed from permanents
    and all "until end of turn" and "this turn" effects end.  These actions
    happen simultaneously.  See Rule 514.2. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 703.4n - When each step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player's
    mana pool empties.  See Rule 500.4. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

704 - State-Based Actions
  704.1 - State-based actions are game actions that happen automatically
    whenever certain conditions (listed below) are met.  State-based actions
    don't use the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.1a - Abilities that watch for a specified game state are triggered
    abilities, not state-based actions.  (See Rule 603, "Handling Triggered
    Abilities.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.2 - State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not
    controlled by any player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.3 - Whenever a player would get priority (see Rule 115, "Timing and
    Priority"), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for
    state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions
    simultaneously as a single event.  If any state-based actions are
    performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all
    triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the
    stack, then the check is repeated.  Once no more state-based actions have
    been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are
    waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority.
    This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see Rule 514), except
    that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the step's
    first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack,
    then no player gets priority and the step ends. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.4 - Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to
    what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls a creature with the ability "This creature's
    power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand"
    and casts a spell whose effect is "Discard your hand, then draw seven
    cards."  The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of
    the spell's resolution but will be back up to toughness 7 when the spell
    finishes resolving.  Thus the creature will survive when state-based
    actions are checked.  In contrast, an ability that triggers when the
    player has no cards in hand goes on the stack after the spell resolves,
    because its trigger event happened during resolution.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5 - The state-based actions are as follows: [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5a - If a player has 0 or less life, he or she loses the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5b - If a player attempted to draw a card from an empty library since
    the last time state-based actions were checked, he or she loses the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5c - If a player has ten or more poison counters, he or she loses the
    game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5d - If a token is phased out, or is in a zone other than the
    battlefield, it ceases to exist. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5e - If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases
    to exist.  If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the
    battlefield, it ceases to exist. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5f - If a creature has toughness 0 or less, it's put into its owner's
    graveyard.  Regeneration can't replace this event. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5g - If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and the total damage
    marked on it is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has
    been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed.  Regeneration can replace this
    event. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5h - If a creature has been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch
    since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is
    destroyed.  Regeneration can replace this event. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5i - If a planeswalker has loyalty 0, it's put into its owner's
    graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5j - If two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type are on
    the battlefield, all are put into their owners' graveyards.  This is
    called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5k - If two or more legendary permanents with the same name are on the
    battlefield, all are put into their owners' graveyards.  This is called
    the "legend rule."  If only one of those permanents is legendary, this
    rule doesn't apply. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5m - If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the
    one that has been a permanent with the world supertype on the battlefield
    for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners' graveyards.  In
    the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their
    owners' graveyards.  This is called the "world rule."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5n - If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, or is not
    attached to an object or player, that Aura is put into its owner's
    graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  704.5p - If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal
    permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent.  It remains on the
    battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 704.5q - If a creature is attached to an object or player, it becomes
    unattached and remains on the battlefield.  Similarly, if a permanent
    that's neither an Aura, an Equipment, nor a Fortification is attached to
    an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  704.5r - If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it,
    N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller
    of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 704.5s - If a permanent with an ability that says it can't have more than N
    counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on
    it, all but N of those counters are removed from it.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 704.5t - In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has 0 or less life, that team
    loses the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 704.5u - In an EDH game, a player that's been dealt 21 or more combat damage
    by the same general over the course of the game loses the game.  (See
    Rule 903.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  704.6 - If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the
    same time, a single replacement effect will replace all of them.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: You control Lich's Mirror, which says "If you would lose the
    game, instead shuffle your hand, your graveyard, and all permanents you
    own into your library, then draw seven cards and your life total
    becomes 20."  There's one card in your library and your life total is 1.
    A spell causes you to draw two cards and lose 2 life.  The next time
    state-based actions are checked, you'd lose the game due to Rule 704.5a
    and Rule 704.5b.  Instead, Lich's Mirror replaces that game loss and you
    keep playing. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

705 - Flipping a Coin
  705.1 - To flip a coin for an object that cares whether a player wins or
    loses the flip, the affected player flips the coin and calls "heads"
    or "tails."  If the call matches the result, that player wins the flip.
    Otherwise, the player loses the flip.  Only the player who flips the coin
    wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  705.2 - To flip a coin for an object that cares whether the coin comes up
    heads or tails, each affected player flips a coin without making a call.
    No player wins or loses this kind of flip. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  705.3 - A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily
    distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up.
    If the coin that's being flipped doesn't have an obvious "heads"
    or "tails," designate one side to be "heads," and the other side to
    be "tails."  Other methods of randomization may be substituted for
    flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal
    likelihood and all players agree to the substitution.  For example, the
    player may roll an even-sided die and call "odds" or "evens," or roll an
    even-sided die and designate that "odds" means "heads" and "evens"
    means "tails." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

706 - Copying Objects
  706.1 - Some objects become or turn another object into a "copy" of a spell,
    permanent, or card.  Some effects put a token onto the battlefield that's
    a copy of another object.  (Certain older cards were printed with the
    phrase "search for a copy."  This section doesn't cover those cards, which
    have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 706.2 - When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the
    original object's characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices
    made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether
    it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on).
    The "copiable values" are the values derived from the text printed on the
    object (that text being name, mana cost, card type, subtype, supertype,
    expansion symbol, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as
    modified by other copy effects, by "as ... enters the battlefield" and "as
    ... is turned face up" abilities that set characteristics, and by
    abilities that caused the object to be face down.  Other
    effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, and
    counters are not copied. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads "{X}: Chimeric Staff
    becomes an X/X artifact creature until end of turn."  Clone is a
    creature that reads, "You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy
    of any creature on the battlefield."  After a Staff has become a 5/5
    artifact creature, a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of it.  The
    Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature.  (The copy has the
    Staff's ability, however, and will become a creature if that ability is
    activated.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down
    Grinning Demon (a creature with morph {2}{B}{B}).  The Clone is a
    colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no types, no abilities, and no mana
    cost.  It will still be face up.  Its controller can't pay {2}{B}{B} to
    turn it face up. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.2a - A copy acquires the color of the object it's copying because that
    value is derived from its mana cost.  A copy acquires the abilities of the
    object it's copying because those values are derived from its rules text.
    A copy doesn't wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it
    doesn't copy the object's abilities and its rules text, then have that
    rules text define a new set of abilities). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.3 - The copy's copiable values become the copied information, as
    modified by the copy's status (see Rule 110.6).  Objects that copy the
    object will use the new copiable values. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Vesuvan Doppelganger reads, "You may have Vesuvan Doppelganger
    enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield except
    it doesn't copy that creature's color and it gains 'At the beginning of
    your upkeep, you may have this creature become a copy of target creature
    except it doesn't copy that creature's color.  If you do, this creature
    gains this ability.'"  A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a
    copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 green Bear creature with no abilities).
    Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Doppelganger.  The
    Clone is a 2/2 blue Bear named Runeclaw Bear that has the Doppelganger's
    upkeep-triggered ability. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Tomoya the Revealer (a flipped flip card) becomes a copy of
    Nezumi Shortfang (an unflipped flip card).  Tomoya's characteristics
    become the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious, which is the
    flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a
    copy of a face-up Branchsnap Lorian (a 4/1 green creature with trample
    and morph {G}).  The Demon's characteristics become the characteristics of
    Branchsnap Lorian.  However, since the creature is face down, it remains
    a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana
    cost.  It can be turned face up for {G}.  If it's turned face up, it will
    have the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a
    copy of Wandering Ones (a 1/1 blue Spirit creature that doesn't have
    morph).  It will be a face-down Wandering Ones.  It remains a 2/2
    colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost.
    Its controller can't turn it face up as a special action.  If an effect
    turns it face up, it will have the characteristics of Wandering Ones.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.4 - Some effects cause a permanent that's copying a permanent to copy a
    different object while remaining on the battlefield.  The change doesn't
    trigger enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities.  This
    also doesn't change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Unstable Shapeshifter reads, "Whenever a creature enters the
    battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and
    gains this ability."  It's affected by Giant Growth, which
    reads "Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn."  If a creature
    enters the battlefield later this turn, Unstable Shapeshifter will become
    a copy of that creature, but it will still get +3/+3 from the Giant
    Growth. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.5 - An object that enters the battlefield "as a copy" or "that's a copy"
    of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield.  It doesn't
    enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent.  If the
    text that's being copied includes any abilities that replace the
    enters-the-battlefield event (such as "enters the battlefield with" or "as
    <this> enters the battlefield" abilities), those abilities will take
    effect.  Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy
    will have a chance to trigger. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Skyshroud Behemoth reads, "Fading 2 (This creature enters the
    battlefield with two fade counters on it.  At the beginning of your
    upkeep, remove a fade counter from it.  If you can't, sacrifice it.)"
    and "Skyshroud Behemoth enters the battlefield tapped."  A Clone that
    enters the battlefield as a copy of a Skyshroud Behemoth will also enter
    the battlefield tapped with two fade counters on it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Striped Bears reads, "When Striped Bears enters the
    battlefield, draw a card."  A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of
    Striped Bears.  The Clone has the Bears' enters-the-battlefield triggered
    ability, so the Clone's controller draws a card. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.6 - When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that
    permanent aren't copied.  Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as
    a copy of another permanent, the object's controller will get to make
    any "as <this> enters the battlefield" choices for it.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of
    Chameleon Spirit.  Chameleon Spirit reads, in part, "As Chameleon
    Spirit enters the battlefield, choose a color."  The Clone won't copy the
    color choice of the Spirit; rather, the controller of the Clone will get
    to make a new choice. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.7 - If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be
    similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them.  One
    ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were
    affected by the other.  They can't be linked to any other ability,
    regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have
    had in the past.  See Rule 607, "Linked Abilities." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.7a - If an ability causes a player to "choose a <value>" or "name a
    card," and a second, linked ability refers to that choice, the second
    ability is the only ability that can refer to that choice.  An object
    doesn't "remember" that choice and use it for other abilities it may copy
    later.  If an object copies an ability that refers to a choice, but
    either (a) doesn't copy that ability's linked ability or (b) does copy the
    linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered
    to be "undefined."  If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part
    of the ability won't do anything. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and
    Unstable Shapeshifter copies it.  Voice of All reads, in part, "As
    Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color." and "Voice of All
    has protection from the chosen color."  Unstable Shapeshifter never had a
    chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn't enter the
    battlefield as a Voice of All card, so the protection ability doesn't
    protect it from anything at all. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of
    Chameleon Spirit, and the Doppelganger's controller chooses blue.
    Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves.  The Elves has the
    ability, "{Tap}: Add one mana of the chosen color to your mana pool." Even
    though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn't chosen for the
    ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves.  If that mana
    ability of the Doppelganger is activated, it will not produce mana.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.8 - Some copy effects give an ability to the copy as part of the copying
    process.  This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy,
    along with any other abilities that were copied.  Also, some copy effects
    specifically state that they don't copy certain characteristics; they
    retain their original values instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an
    Unstable Shapeshifter copies it.  The copiable values of the
    Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter
    also has the ability "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable
    Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability." Then
    a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter.
    The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including
    the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.9 - To copy a spell or activated ability means to put a copy of it onto
    the stack; a copy of a spell isn't cast and a copy of an activated ability
    isn't activated.  A copy of a spell or ability copies both the
    characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it,
    including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative
    costs.  (See Rule 601, "Casting Spells.")  Choices that are normally made
    on resolution are not copied.  If an effect of the copy refers to objects
    used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the
    original spell or ability.  A copy of a spell is owned by the player under
    whose control it was put on the stack.  A copy of a spell or ability is
    controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack.  A
    copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card
    associated with it.  A copy of an ability is itself an ability.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm.  Fork
    reads, "Copy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red.
    You may choose new targets for the copy."  Emerald Charm is a green
    instant that reads, "Choose one -- Untap target permanent; or destroy
    target non-Aura enchantment; or target creature loses flying until end of
    turn."  When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the
    stack except the copy is red, not green.  The copy has the same mode that
    was chosen for the original Emerald Charm.  It does not necessarily have
    the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Fling is an instant that reads, "As an additional cost to cast
    Fling, sacrifice a creature" and "Fling deals damage equal to the
    sacrificed creature's power to target creature or player."  When
    determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of
    the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.9a - If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases
    to exist.  If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the
    battlefield, it ceases to exist.  These are state-based actions.  See
    Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.9b - A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability.
    If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same
    object and not to any other object with the same name.  The copy is
    considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times
    that ability has resolved during the turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.9c - Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller
    may choose new targets for the copy.  The player may leave any number of
    the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal.  If the
    player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must
    be legal.  Once the player has decided what the copy's targets will be,
    the copy is put onto the stack with those targets. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.10 - If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks
    that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something
    else. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: An Unstable Shapeshifter copies a Crazed Armodon.  Crazed
    Armodon reads, "{G}: Crazed Armodon gets +3/+0 and gains trample until end
    of turn.  Destroy Crazed Armodon at the beginning of the next end step.
    Activate this ability only once each turn."  If this ability of the
    Shapeshifter is activated, the Shapeshifter will be destroyed at the
    beginning of the next end step, even if it's no longer a copy of Crazed
    Armodon at that time. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  706.11 - An effect that instructs a player to "cast a copy" of an object
    follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is cast while
    another spell or ability is resolving.  Casting a copy of an object
    follows Rule 601.2a through Rule 601.2g, "Casting Spells," then the copy
    becomes cast.  The cast copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any
    other spell it can resolve or be countered. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

707 - Face-Down Spells and Permanents
  707.1 - Two cards (Illusionary Mask and Ixidron) and the morph
    ability (see Rule 702.34) allow spells and permanents to be face down.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.2 - Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics
    other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the spell or
    permanent to be face down.  Any listed characteristics are the copiable
    values of that object's characteristics.  (See Rule 613, "Interaction of
    Continuous Effects," and Rule 706, "Copying Objects.")
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.2a - If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability,
    it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, no
    expansion symbol, and no mana cost.  These values are the copiable values
    of that object's characteristics. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.3 - Objects that are put onto the battlefield face down are turned face
    down before they enter the battlefield, so the permanent's
    enters-the-battlefield abilities won't trigger (if triggered) or have any
    effect (if static). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.4 - Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are
    put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a
    spell will see only the face-down spell's characteristics.  Any effects or
    prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these
    characteristics (and not the face-up object's characteristics) are applied
    to casting this object. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.5 - At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the
    stack or a face-down permanent you control (even if it's phased out).  You
    can't look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or
    permanents controlled by another player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.6 - If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents,
    you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can
    be easily differentiated from each other.  This includes, but is not
    limited to, knowing the order spells were cast, the order that face-down
    permanents entered the battlefield, which creature attacked last turn, and
    any other differences between face-down spells or permanents.  Common
    methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using
    counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those
    objects in order on the table. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.7 - The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also
    allow the permanent's controller to turn it face up.  Spells normally
    can't be turned face up. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.8 - As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values
    revert to its normal copiable values.  Any effects that have been applied
    to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent.  Any
    abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don't trigger
    and don't have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the
    battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.9 - If a face-down permanent moves from the battlefield to any other
    zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as he or she moves it.  If a
    face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the
    battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as he or she moves
    it.  At the end of each game, all face-down permanents and spells must be
    revealed to all players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.10 - If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its
    copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified
    by its face-down status.  Its characteristics therefore remain the same:
    the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be
    turned face down.  However, if it is turned face up, its copiable values
    become the values it copied from the other permanent.  See Rule 706.3.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  707.11 - If a face-down permanent would have an "As <this permanent> is
    turned face up..." ability after it's turned face up, that ability is
    applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

708 - Split Cards
  708.1 - Split cards have two card faces on a single card.  The back of a
    split card is the normal Magic: The Gathering card back.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.2 - In every zone except the stack, split cards have two sets of
    characteristics and two converted mana costs.  As long as a split card is
    a spell on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast
    exist.  The other half's characteristics are treated as though they didn't
    exist. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.3 - Each split card that consists of two halves with different colored
    mana symbols in their mana costs is a multicolored card while it's not a
    spell on the stack.  While it's a spell on the stack, it's only the color
    or colors of the half being cast. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.4 - Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is
    only one card.  For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split
    card has drawn or discarded one card, not two. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.5 - An effect that asks for a particular characteristic of a split card
    while it's in a zone other than the stack gets two answers (one for each
    of the split card's two halves). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Infernal Genesis has an ability that reads, "At the beginning
    of each player's upkeep, that player puts the top card from his or her
    library into his or her graveyard.  He or she then puts X 1/1 black Minion
    creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is that card's converted
    mana cost."  If the top card of your library is
    Assault (Assault/Battery) when this ability resolves, the game sees its
    converted mana cost as "1, and 4."  You get five creature tokens.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.6 - Some effects perform comparisons involving characteristics of one or
    more split cards in a zone other than the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.6a - An effect that performs a positive comparison (such as asking if a
    card is red) or a relative comparison (such as asking if a card's
    converted mana cost is less than 2) involving characteristics of one or
    more split cards in any zone other than the stack gets only one answer.
    This answer is "yes" if either side of each split card in the comparison
    would return a "yes" answer if compared individually.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.6b - An effect that performs a negative comparison (such as asking if
    cards have different names) involving characteristics of one or more split
    cards in any zone other than the stack also gets only one answer.  This
    answer is "yes" if performing the analogous positive comparison would
    return a "no" answer. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.6c - If an effect performs a comparison involving multiple
    characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the
    stack, each characteristic is compared separately.  If each of the
    individual comparisons would return a "yes" answer, the whole comparison
    returns a "yes" answer. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Void reads, "Choose a number.  Destroy all artifacts and
    creatures with converted mana cost equal to that number.  Then target
    player reveals his or her hand and discards all nonland cards with
    converted mana cost equal to the number."  If a player casts Void and
    chooses 1, his or her opponent would discard Assault (Assault/Battery)
    because the game sees its converted mana cost as "1, and 4."  The same is
    true if the player chooses 4.  If the player chooses 5, however,
    Assault/Battery would be unaffected. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  708.7 - If an effect instructs a player to name a card and the player wants
    to name a split card, the player must name both halves of the split card.
    An object has the chosen name if it has at least one of the two names
    chosen this way. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

709 - Flip Cards
  709.1 - Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card.  The text
    that appears right side up on the card defines the card's normal
    characteristics.  Additional alternative characteristics appear upside
    down on the card.  The back of a flip card is the normal Magic: The
    Gathering card back. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.1a - The top half of a flip card contains the card's normal name, text
    box, type line, power, and toughness.  The text box usually contains an
    ability that causes the permanent to "flip" if certain conditions are met.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.1b - The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text
    box, type line, power, and toughness.  These characteristics are used only
    if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the permanent is
    flipped. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.1c - A flip card's color, mana cost, expansion symbol, illustration
    credit, and legal text don't change if the permanent is flipped.  Also,
    any changes to it by external effects will still apply.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.2 - In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the
    battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal
    characteristics of the card.  Once a permanent is flipped, its normal
    name, text box, type line, power, and toughness don't apply and the
    alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a
    legendary creature named Tok-Tok, Volcano Born.  An effect that
    says "search your library for a legendary card" can't find this flip card.
    An effect that says "legendary creatures get +2/+2" doesn't affect Akki
    Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.3 - You must ensure that it's clear at all times whether a permanent you
    control is flipped or not, both when it's untapped and when it's tapped.
    Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents
    include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.4 - Flipping a permanent is a one-way process.  Once a permanent is
    flipped, it's impossible for it to become unflipped.  However, if a
    flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its
    status.  See Rule 110.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  709.5 - If an effect instructs a player to name a card and the player wants
    to name a flip card's alternative name, the player may do so.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

710 - Controlling Another Player's Turn
+ 710.1 - Two cards (Mindslaver and Sorin Markov) allow a player's turn
    to be controlled by another player.  This effect applies to the next turn
    that the affected player actually takes.  The entire turn is controlled;
    the effect doesn't end until the beginning of the next turn.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  710.1a - Multiple turn-controlling effects that affect the same player
    overwrite each other.  The last one to be created is the one that works.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.1b - If a turn is skipped, any pending turn-controlling effects wait
    until the player who would be affected actually takes a turn.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.1c - Only the control of the turn changes.  All objects are controlled
    by their normal controllers. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.2 - The player whose turn is being controlled is still the active
    player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.3 - If information about an object would be visible to the player whose
    turn is controlled, it's visible to both that player and the controller of
    the turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The controller of a player's turn can see that player's hand and
    the identity of any face-down creatures he or she controls.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 710.4 - The controller of another player's turn makes all choices and
    decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that
    turn by the rules or by any objects.  This includes choices and decisions
    about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and
    abilities. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The controller of the turn decides which spells the active player
    casts and what those spells target, and makes any required decisions when
    those spells resolve. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The controller of the turn decides which of active player's
    creatures attack, which player or planeswalker each one attacks, what the
    damage assignment order the creatures that block them is, and how those
    attacking creatures assign their combat damage. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  710.4a - The controller of another player's turn can use only that player's
    resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If the controller of the turn decides that the active player will
    cast a spell with an additional cost of discarding cards, the cards are
    discarded from the active player's hand. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.4b - The controller of another player's turn can't make choices or
    decisions for that player that aren't called for by the rules or by any
    objects.  The controller also can't make any choices or decisions for the
    player that would be called for by the tournament rules.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The player whose turn is being controlled still chooses whether
    he or she leaves to visit the restroom, trades a card to someone else,
    takes an intentional draw, or calls a judge about an error or infraction.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.5 - The controller of another player's turn can't make that player
    concede.  A player may concede the game at any time, even if his or her
    turn is controlled by another player.  See Rule 104.3a.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  710.6 - A player who controls another player's turn also continues to make
    his or her own choices and decisions. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

711 - Ending the Turn
  711.1 - One card (Time Stop) ends the turn when it resolves.  When an
    effect ends the turn, follow these steps in order, as they differ from the
    normal process for resolving spells and abilities (see
    Rule 608, "Resolving Spells and Abilities"). [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 711.1a - Exile every object on the stack, including the object that's
    resolving.  Remove all creatures and planeswalkers (including those that
    are phased out) from combat.  All objects not on the battlefield that
    aren't represented by cards will cease to exist the next time state-based
    actions are checked (see Rule 704, "State-Based Actions").
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  711.1b - Check state-based actions.  No player gets priority, and no
    triggered abilities are put onto the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  711.1c - The current phase and/or step ends.  The game skips straight to the
    cleanup step.  Skip any phases or steps between this phase or step and the
    cleanup step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  711.2 - No player gets priority during this process, so triggered abilities
    are not put onto the stack.  If any triggered abilities have triggered
    between the spell or ability resolving and the cleanup step ending, those
    abilities are put onto the stack during the cleanup step, then the active
    player gets priority and players can cast spells and activate abilities.
    Then there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends.  If
    no triggered abilities have triggered during this process, no player gets
    priority during the cleanup step.  See Rule 514, "Cleanup Step."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  711.3 - Even though the turn ends, "at the beginning of the end step"
    triggered abilities don't trigger because the end step is skipped.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

712 - Subgames
  712.1 - One card (Shahrazad) allows players to play a Magic subgame.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 712.1a - A "subgame" is a completely separate Magic game created by an
    effect.  Essentially, it's a game within a game.  The "main game" is the
    game in which the spell or ability that created the subgame was cast or
    activated.  The main game is temporarily discontinued while the subgame is
    in progress.  It resumes when the subgame ends. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  712.1b - No effects or definitions created in either the main game or the
    subgame have any meaning in the other, except as defined by the effect
    that created the subgame.  For example, the effect may say that something
    happens in the main game to the winner or loser of the subgame.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.2 - As the subgame starts, an entirely new set of game zones is created.
    Each player takes all the cards in his or her main-game library, moves
    them to his or her subgame library, and shuffles them.  No other cards in
    a main-game zone are moved to their corresponding subgame zone.  Randomly
    determine which player goes first.  The subgame proceeds like a normal
    game, following all other rules in Rule 103, "Starting the Game."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.3 - Any rules regarding the size of a player's deck are ignored for the
    subgame.  However, because each player draws seven cards when a game
    begins, any player with fewer than seven cards in his or her deck will
    lose the subgame when state-based actions are checked during the upkeep
    step of the first turn, regardless of any mulligans that player
    takes.  (See Rule 704, "State-Based Actions.") [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.4 - All objects in the main game and all cards outside the main game are
    considered outside the subgame (except those specifically brought into the
    subgame).  All players not currently in the subgame are considered outside
    the subgame. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.4a - Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it.  If a
    card is brought into a subgame from a main game, abilities in the main
    game that trigger on objects leaving a main-game zone will trigger, but
    they won't be put onto the stack until the main game resumes.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.5 - At the end of a subgame, each player puts all cards he or she owns
    that are in the subgame into his or her library in the main game, then
    shuffles them.  This includes cards in the subgame's exile zone.  All
    other objects in the subgame cease to exist, as do the zones created for
    the subgame.  The main game continues from the point at which it was
    discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame
    finishes resolving, even if it was created by a spell card that's no
    longer on the stack.  Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the
    subgame was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game,
    those abilities are put onto the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If a card was brought into the subgame either from the main game
    or from outside the main game, that card will be put into its owner's
    main-game library when the subgame ends. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  712.6 - A subgame can be created within a subgame.  The existing subgame
    becomes the main game in relation to the new subgame.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

713 - Taking Shortcuts
  713.1 - When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually
    understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game
    choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.1a - The rules for taking shortcuts are largely unformalized.  As long
    as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player,
    any shortcut system they use is acceptable. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.1b - Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions
    could be repeated indefinitely (thus creating a "loop").  In that case,
    the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions
    are repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is
    broken. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.2 - Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.2a - At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a
    shortcut by describing a sequence of game choices, for all players, that
    may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable
    results of the sequence of choices.  This sequence may be a non-repetitive
    series of choices, a loop that repeats a specified number of times,
    multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns.  It
    can't include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event
    determines the next action a player takes.  The ending point of this
    sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not
    be the player proposing the shortcut. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls a creature enchanted by Presence of Gond,
    which grants the creature the ability "{Tap}: Put a 1/1 green Elf Warrior
    creature token onto the battlefield," and another player controls
    Intruder Alarm, which reads, in part, "Whenever a creature enters the
    battlefield, untap all creatures."  When the player has priority, he may
    suggest "I'll create a million tokens," indicating the sequence of
    activating the creature's ability, all players passing priority, letting
    the creature's ability resolve and put a token onto the battlefield (which
    causes Intruder Alarm's ability to trigger), Intruder Alarm's controller
    putting that triggered ability on the stack, all players passing priority,
    Intruder Alarm's triggered ability resolving, all players passing priority
    until the player proposing the shortcut has priority, and repeating that
    sequence 999,999 more times, ending just after the last token-creating
    ability resolves. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.2b - Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who
    suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or
    shorten it by naming a place where he or she will make a game choice
    that's different than what's been proposed.  (The player doesn't need to
    specify at this time what the new choice will be.)  This place becomes the
    new ending point of the proposed sequence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then
    says, "Go."  The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant
    that says "Target creature attacks this turn if able") and says, "I'd like
    to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step."  The current
    proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities
    during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the
    beginning of combat step. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.2c - Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut
    proposal, the shortcut is taken.  The game advances to the last proposed
    ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal
    having been taken.  If the shortcut was shortened from the original
    proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game
    choice than what was originally proposed for that player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 713.3 - Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player
    involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the
    same game state being reached multiple times.  If that happens, the active
    player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first
    player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game
    choice so the loop does not continue. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: In a two-player game, the active player controls a creature with
    the ability "{0}: <This creature> gains flying," the nonactive player
    controls a permanent with the ability "{0}: Target creature loses flying,"
    and nothing in the game cares how many times an ability has been
    activated.  Say the active player activates his creature's ability, it
    resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanent's ability
    targeting that creature, and it resolves.  This returns the game to a game
    state it was at before.  The active player must make a different game
    choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creature's
    ability again).  The creature doesn't have flying.  Note that the
    nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop simply by not
    activating her permanent's ability, in which case the creature would have
    had flying.  The nonactive player always has the final choice and is
    therefore able to determine whether the creature has flying.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.4 - If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game ends in a
    draw.  (See Rule 104.4b.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.5 - No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop
    other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A player controls Seal of Cleansing, an enchantment that
    reads, "Sacrifice Seal of Cleansing: Destroy target artifact or
    enchantment."  A mandatory loop that involves an artifact begins.  The
    player is not forced to sacrifice Seal of Cleansing to destroy the
    artifact and end the loop. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  713.6 - If a loop contains an effect that says "<A> unless <B>," where <A>
    and <B> are each actions, no player can be forced to perform <B> to break
    the loop.  If no player chooses to perform <B>, the loop will continue as
    though <A> were mandatory. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

714 - Handling Illegal Actions
  714.1 - If a player realizes that he or she can't legally take an action
    after starting to do so, the entire action is reversed and any payments
    already made are canceled.  No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a
    result of an undone action.  If the action was casting a spell, the spell
    returns to the zone it came from.  The player may also reverse any legal
    mana abilities activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from
    them or from any triggered mana abilities they triggered was spent on
    another mana ability that wasn't reversed.  Players may not reverse
    actions that moved cards to a library or from a library to any zone other
    than the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  714.2 - When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had
    priority retains it and may take another action or pass.  The player may
    redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed
    by the rules. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

715 - Unglued & Unhinged
  715.1 - Unglued and Unhinged are unusual Magic expansions.
  715.Ruling.1 - Unglued and Unhinged were designed to be funny.  Keep that in
    mind. [D'Angelo 2006/02/01]
  715.Ruling.2 - It is very unlikely that you'll manage to get the NetReps or
    Customer Service to agree on some rulings for these cards. So, if there
    are two or more rulings from official people out there, use the one that
    you think will be funniest.  In Arena, the Arena judge chooses.  In
    friendly play, agree amongst yourselves, or toss a coin.
    [Barclay 1998/08/13]
  715.Ruling.3 - Some cards in Unglued have a picture and no text.  These are
    intended for use to represent token creatures for you so you don't have
    use coins, glass beads, kittens, pick-up trucks, or other handy objects.
    [QAS 1998/09/09]
    When using one of these to represent a token creature, they count as
    tokens, not cards. [QAS 1998/09/09]
  715.Ruling.4 - A teammate is a player who shares a victory condition with
    you.  In other words, you both work together to win and win as a team.
    [QAS 1998/09/09]
    Partnership and Emperor formats have teammates.  Grand Melee and normal
    two-player games do not.
  715.Ruling.5 - When judging if a person performed a subjective task
    correctly, use your best judgment.  An honest attempt which falls a little
    short should not be penalized. [QAS 1998/09/09]
    Subjective tasks include rhyming, doing an action for Bureaucracy,
    complimenting an opponent, etc.
  715.Ruling.6 - Any random source with the same odds can replace a coin toss
    or die roll. [QAS 1998/09/09]
    But the replacement still counts as its original type.  For example,
    rolling a die to simulate a coin counts as a coin flip and not a die roll.
    [D'Angelo 1998/09/09]
  715.Ruling.7 - You cannot target a player in a different game.
    [QAS 1998/09/09]
  715.Ruling.8 - If you rip up or mark a card in a tournament because you are
    required to do so by a spell or ability, your deck is not made illegal.
    Instead, before the next game, you must bring your deck back up to 60
    cards by borrowing from your sideboard (if your sideboard has any more
    cards and if your deck fell below 60). [QAS 1998/09/09]
  715.Ruling.9 - If you are required to remove cards from your deck or
    sideboard for the duration of a match a tournament, your deck is not made
    illegal.  Instead, before the next game, you must bring your deck back up
    to 60 cards by borrowing from your sideboard (if your sideboard has any
    more cards and if your deck fell below 60). [QAS 1998/09/09]
  715.Ruling.10 - You cannot use a coin with two heads (or tails) or a die
    which does not have values that can clearly be divided into the right
    number of equal sets, as per Rule 715.Ruling.6. [D'Angelo 1998/10/23]
  715.Ruling.11 - When asked to choose an artist, you can only choose one that
    has illustrated at least one Magic card. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
  715.Ruling.12 - Use the artist name printed on the card, even if the name is
    not correct or if some other version of the card has different art.  A
    typo does not count as a different artist, but a pseudonym does.
    Nicknames are also ignored, as with "Pete 'Fear Me' Venters" being the
    same as "Pete Venters".  Any card illustrated by more than one artist is
    considered to be illustrated by both artists. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
  715.Ruling.13 - When playing with silver bordered cards, all numbers in
    Magic that would normally be restricted to whole numbers as per Rule 104.1
    are now allowed to be whole numbers or half numbers, such as "2.5".  This
    applies to power, toughness, mana, life, damage, and so on.
    [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
    For example, if you have 20 life and take 3.5 damage, you now have 16.5
    life.  And if you end a phase with 0.5 unspent mana points in your pool,
    you lose 0.5 life.  As another example, you can use Pyrotechnics to
    deal 0.5 damage to each of 8 creatures. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
    It does not apply to the number of counters.  You can't have half a
    counter. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
  715.Ruling.14 - Gotcha cards trigger if the opponent says the word exactly.
    Plurals count ("guys" and "guy" are equivalent).  Homophones do not
    count ("eye" and "I" are not equivalent).  Homographs and homonyms do
    count ("contract" as a verb or noun).  Parts of a word do not
    count ("lifeline" does not trigger if the word is "life").
    [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
  715.Ruling.15 - Some cards require a mini game, such as Eye to Eye's
    staring contest.  You have to win the game honestly.  No blowing in their
    face, for example.  A player can always concede the game instead of
    playing it. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]
  715.Ruling.16 - When playing with silver bordered cards, all color choices
    that would normally be restricted are open to any color choices you want.
    You can choose brown, for example. [Unhinged FAQ 2004/11/15]

716 - Licids
  716.1 - A Licid is a type of creature that can become a creature
    enchantment, reside on other creatures for a while, and then revert back
    to being a creature. [Tempest, Page 7]
  716.Ruling.1 - When a Licid becomes a creature enchantment, it loses all
    abilities and gains whatever ability is listed in the card text.  It also
    stops being whatever kind of permanent it was and becomes a local creature
    enchantment.  It retains all other characteristics including name, color,
    and so on. [Tempest, Page 8]   [WotC Rules Team 1997/12/18]
  716.Ruling.2 - The Licid ability targets the creature it will be enchanting.
    If the target becomes illegal before the ability starts to resolve, then
    the ability is countered and the Licid will remain unchanged.
    [Tempest, Page 9]
  716.Ruling.3 - When a Licid changes form, any counters, effects, and damage
    on it remain on it until they would normally be removed (if ever).  If the
    counters or effects make no sense when applied to the current card type,
    then they do not do anything.  But if the Licid returns to being of the
    proper card type, they may take effect again. [D'Angelo 1998/07/24]
    For example, a +1/+1 counter from Dwarven Weaponsmith would remain, the
    effect of Giant Growth will wear off at end of turn, and damage will be
    removed at end of turn.
  716.Ruling.4 - Generally, the cost of using a Licid's ability includes
    tapping it.  This means that when it moves onto the creature, it will be a
    tapped local enchantment.  The enchantment's ability will work normally,
    though, and the card will untap during your next untap step.
    [Tempest, Page 9]
  716.Ruling.5 - A Licid will not get summoning sickness by enchanting an
    opponent's permanent.  You are still controlling the Licid.
    [D'Angelo 1997/10/15]
  716.Ruling.6 - If a Licid is enchanting a creature that phases out, the
    Licid phases out with the creature, and when it phases back in it will
    phase in still as a local enchantment. [D'Angelo 2000/04/04]
  716.Ruling.7 - When in creature enchantment form, it can be moved onto
    another creature with an enchantment moving spell or ability.  It stays as
    an enchantment. [WotC Rules Team 1998/02/01]
  716.Ruling.8 - If a Licid tries to enchant a creature that cannot be
    enchanted, it will still move through to resolution because the Licid's
    text does not require the thing it will enchant to be a legal thing to
    enchant.  During resolution it will then turn into an enchantment and try
    to enchant the chosen permanent.  Since the permanent cannot be enchanted,
    the Licid is placed into the graveyard. [WotC Rules Team 2003/12/01]
  716.Ruling.9 - If a Licid tries to enchant itself, it will see itself as a
    legal place to go at the beginning of resolution.  It will then turn into
    an enchantment and enchant itself.  Since it is not legal to enchant
    itself, the Licid is placed into the graveyard. [Jordan 2002/01/11]

717 - Keyword Abilities
  717.1 - Radiance is a keyword ability written as "Radiance - [ability]".  ".
  717.1.Ruling.1 - Radiance has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in
    itself.  The ability listed following the keyword is the actual effect.
    Radiance is simply used to show that the card has a similar ability to
    other cards that use this keyword. [D'Angelo 2005/11/01]
  717.2 - Sweep is a keyword ability written as "Sweep - [ability]".  ".
  717.2.Ruling.1 - Sweep has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in

  717.3.Ruling.1 - Channel has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in
    itself.  The ability listed following the keyword is the actual effect.
    Channel is simply used to show that the card has a similar ability to
    other cards that use this keyword. [D'Angelo 2005/12/01]
  717.3.Ruling.2 - Channel abilities are always activated abilities that are
    played while the card is in your hand.  The cost of playing the ability
    always includes discarding the card.  This makes playing the ability look
    similar to playing a spell, except the card goes to the graveyard when
    playing the ability instead of when a spell would resolve.
    [D'Angelo 2005/12/01]
  717.3.Ruling.3 - Since Channel abilities are abilities and not spells, they
    are more difficult to counter than spells are. [D'Angelo 2005/12/01]
  717.4 - Hellbent is a keyword ability written as "Hellbent - [ability]".  ".
  717.4.Ruling.1 - Hellbent has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in

  717.4.Ruling.2 - If a Hellbent ability of a spell is a self-replacement that
    changes the effect of that spell, the number of cards in its controller's
    hand is checked as the spell resolves.  It is not checked when the spell
    is played. [Dissension FAQ 2006/04/13]
  717.4.Ruling.3 - If a Hellbent ability of a permanent is an activated
    ability, the number of cards in the permanent's controller's hand is
    checked when that player tries to play the ability.  It is not checked
    when it resolves. [Dissension FAQ 2006/04/13]
  717.4.Ruling.4 - If a Hellbent ability of a permenent is a triggered
    ability, the number of cards in the permanent's controller's hand is
    checked both when that ability would trigger and when the ability would
    resolve.  If the player has one or more cards in his or her hand when the
    ability would trigger, it won't trigger.  If the player has one or more
    cards in his or her hand when the ability would resolve, the ability does
    nothing. [Dissension FAQ 2006/04/13]
  717.5 - Grandeur is a keyword ability written as "Grandeur - [ability]".  ".
  717.5.Ruling.1 - Grandeur has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in

  717.6.Ruling.2 - You don't have to reveal the top card of your library, even
    if it shares a creature type with the creature that has the kinship
    ability. [Morningtide FAQ 2008/01/15]
  717.6.Ruling.3 - After the kinship ability finishes resolving, the card you
    looked at remains on top of your library. [Morningtide FAQ 2008/01/15]
  717.7 - Chroma is a keyword ability written as "Chroma - [ability]".  ".
  717.7.Ruling.1 - Chroma has no meaning in itself and has no game effect in
    itself.  The ability listed following the keyword is the actual effect.
    Chroma is simply used to show that the card has a similar ability to other

8 - Multiplayer Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

800 - General
  800.1 - A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players.
    This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for
    multiplayer play. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.2 - These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a
    multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play.  A
    single game may use multiple options but only one variant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.3 - Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not
    included here, including rules for deck construction.  See the most
    current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information.  They
    can be found at
    <http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=dci/doccenter/home>.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4 - Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or
    more players have left the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4a - When a player leaves the game, all objects (see Rule 109) owned by
    that player leave the game, all spells and abilities controlled by that
    player on the stack cease to exist, and any change-of-control effects
    which give that player control of any objects end.  Then, if there are any
    objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled.  This
    is not a state-based action.  It happens as soon as the player leaves the
    game.  If the player who left the game had priority at the time he or she
    left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who's still in the
    game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex casts Control Magic, an Aura that reads, "You control
    enchanted creature," on Bianca's Wall of Wood.  If Alex leaves the
    game, so does Control Magic, and Wall of Wood reverts to Bianca's control.
    If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Wall of Wood, and Control
    Magic is put into Alex's graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex casts Threaten, which reads, in part, "Untap target
    creature and gain control of it until end of turn," targeting Bianca's
    Wall of Wood.  If Alex leaves the game, Threaten's change-of-control
    effect ends and Wall of Wood reverts to Bianca's control.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, "Search target opponent's
    library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under
    your control.  Then that player shuffles his or her library," targeting
    Bianca.  Alex puts Wall of Wood onto the battlefield from Bianca's
    library.  If Bianca leaves the game, Wall of Wood also leaves the game.
    If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Wall of Wood is exiled.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, "Whenever a
    nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if Genesis Chamber is untapped,
    that creature's controller puts a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature
    token onto the battlefield."  If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens
    that entered the battlefield under Alex's control leave the game, and all
    such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player's
    control remain in the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4b - If an object would change to the control of a player who has left
    the game, it doesn't.  If a token would enter the battlefield under the
    control of a player who has left the game, no token is created.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4c - If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game
    would be created in any zone, it isn't created.  If a triggered ability
    that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put
    onto the stack, it isn't put on the stack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, "Whenever a player
    cycles a card, you may exile target creature.  If you do, return that
    creature to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of
    the next end step."  During Alex's turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide's
    ability to exile Alex's Hypnotic Specter.  Before the end of that turn,
    Bianca leaves the game.  At the beginning of the end step, the delayed
    triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic
    Specter to play triggers, but it isn't put on the stack.  Hypnotic Specter
    never returns to the battlefield. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4d - If combat damage would be dealt to a player who has left the game,
    that damage simply isn't dealt. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4e - If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a
    choice, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that
    choice.  If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the
    controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if
    possible. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4f - If an effect requires information about a specific player, the
    effect uses the current information about that player if he or she is
    still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information
    about that player before he or she left the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4g - If a player leaves the game during his or her turn, that turn
    continues to its completion without an active player.  If the active
    player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order
    receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase
    or step ends, whichever is appropriate. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  800.4h - When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante
    zone do not leave the game.  This is an exception to Rule 800.4a.  See
    Rule 407, "Ante." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 800.4i - In a Planar Magic game, if the player designated as the planar
    controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order
    that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old
    planar controller leaves the game.  See Rule 309.5. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  800.5 - In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he
    or she draws a new hand of seven cards rather than six cards.  Subsequent
    hands decrease by one card as normal.  The Two-Headed Giant variant
    employs more extensive changes to the mulligan rule; see Rule 806.6a.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

801 - Limited Range of Influence Option
  801.1 - Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most
    multiplayer games.  It's always used in the Emperor variant (see
    Rule 807), and it's often used for games involving five or more players.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.2 - A player's range of influence is the maximum distance from that
    player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect.  Players
    within that many seats of the player are within that player's range of
    influence.  Objects controlled by players within a player's range of
    influence are also within that player's range of influence.  Range of
    influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking,
    making choices, and winning the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.2a - The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat
    and 2 seats.  Different players may have different ranges of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players
    seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to
    your left and the two players to your right are within your range of
    influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.2b - A player is always within his or her own range of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.2c - The particular players within each player's range of influence are
    determined as each turn begins. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the
    left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob.  Carissa is not in
    Alex's range of influence.  If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter
    Alex's range of influence at the start of the next turn.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.2d - An object is within a player's range of influence if it's
    controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of
    that player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.3 - Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller's range
    of influence or planeswalkers controlled by those opponents.  If no
    opponents are within a player's range of influence, creatures that player
    controls can't attack. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.4 - Objects and players outside a player's range of influence can't be
    the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.5 - Some cards require players to make choices.  These cards work
    differently when the limited range of influence option is used.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.5a - If a player is asked to choose an object or player, he or she must
    choose one within his or her range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the
    left of Rob.  Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which
    reads, "Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to target creature or player and 1
    damage to target creature or player of an opponent's choice," targeting
    Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target.  Rob must
    choose a target that's in both his range of influence and in the range of
    influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches.  He must therefore choose
    himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.5b - If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not
    between one or more objects or players), he or she can choose between
    those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside
    the player's range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of
    Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the
    right of Rob.  Alex casts a spell that reads, "An opponent chooses one --
    You draw 2 cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of
    turn," and chooses Carissa to make that choice.  Carissa can choose the
    mode even though Alex is out of her range. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.5c - If an effect requires a choice and there's no player who can make
    that choice within its controller's range of influence, the closest
    appropriate player to its controller's left makes that choice.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of
    influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, "Reveal the
    top five cards of your library.  An opponent separates those cards into
    two piles.  Put one pile into your hand and the other into your
    graveyard." Since no opponent is within the emperor's range of influence,
    the nearest opponent to the emperor's left separates the cards into piles.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.6 - A player can't activate the activated abilities of an object outside
    of his or her range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 801.7 - A triggered ability doesn't trigger unless its trigger event happens
    entirely within the range of influence of its source's controller.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is
    seated to the left of Rob.  Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex's
    Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition "Whenever enchanted
    creature becomes blocked," and one with the trigger condition "Whenever
    enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature."  Alex's Runeclaw Bear
    attacks the player to Alex's left and becomes blocked.  The ability of
    Rob's first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes
    blocked) happens within Rob's range of influence.  The ability of Rob's
    second Aura doesn't trigger, however, because that event includes the
    blocking creature, which is out of Rob's range. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  801.7a - If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a
    player's range of influence, use the game state before or after the event
    as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger.
    See Rule 603.6. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each other's range of influence.
    Carissa controls a creature owned by Alex and they each control a
    Soul Net, an artifact which reads, "Whenever a creature is put into a
    graveyard from the battlefield, you may pay {1}.  If you do, you gain 1
    life."  The creature is destroyed and is put into Alex's graveyard.
    Alex's Soul Net doesn't trigger because the destruction event was outside
    Alex's range of influence.  Carissa's Soul Net does trigger, even though
    the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the
    destruction event was within her range. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.8 - An Aura can't enchant an object or player outside its controller's
    range of influence.  If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or
    player, the Aura is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based
    action.  See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.9 - An Equipment can't equip an object outside its controller's range of
    influence, and a Fortification can't fortify an object outside its
    controller's range of influence.  If an Equipment or Fortification is
    attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that
    permanent but remains on the battlefield.  This is a state-based action.
    See Rule 704. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.10 - Spells and abilities can't affect objects or players outside their
    controller's range of influence.  The parts of the effect that attempt to
    affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing.  The rest of the
    effect will work normally. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of
    influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which reads, "Pyroclasm deals 2
    damage to each creature."  Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature
    controlled by Alex, the player to Alex's left, and the player to Alex's
    right.  No other creatures are dealt damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.11 - If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets
    only information from within its controller's range of influence.  It
    doesn't see objects or events outside its controller's range of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1,
    Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, "Each creature gets +1/+1 for
    each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature
    type with it."  Coat of Arms will boost Alex's creatures based only on
    what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex's left, and the
    player to Alex's right.  It won't take other creatures into account.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex.
    Coat of Arms will boost Rob's creatures based only on what creatures
    are controlled by Rob and Alex.  They are the only two players within
    range of both Rob and the controller of Coat of Arms.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.12 - The "legend rule" (see Rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if
    other legendary permanents with the same name are within its controller's
    range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex has range of influence 1, and Carissa has range of
    influence 2.  Rob sits between them.  If Alex controls a legendary
    permanent and Carissa puts a legendary permanent with the same name onto
    the battlefield, only the one controlled by Carissa will be put into a
    graveyard. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.13 - The "world rule" (see Rule 704.5m) applies to a permanent only if
    other world permanents are within its controller's range of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.14 - The "planeswalker uniqueness rule" (see Rule 704.5j) applies to a
    planeswalker only if other planeswalkers with the same planeswalker type
    are within its controller's range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.15 - Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to
    happen and then completely or partially replace that event.  The limited
    range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain
    instructions that can't be carried out, in which case the player simply
    ignores the impossible instructions.  See Rule 614, "Replacement Effects,"
    and Rule 615, "Prevention Effects." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.15a - If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to
    affect an object or player outside its controller's range of influence,
    that portion of the event does nothing. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Alex casts Lava Axe ("Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target
    player") targeting Rob.  In response, Rob casts
    Captain's Maneuver ("The next X damage that would be dealt to target
    creature or player this turn is dealt to another target creature or player
    instead") with X equal to 3, targeting Carissa.  Carissa isn't in Alex's
    range of influence.  When Lava Axe resolves, it deals 2 damage to Rob and
    no damage to Carissa. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.15b - If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that
    would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or
    ability's controller's range of influence.  If a spell or ability creates
    an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a creature or
    player, it can affect only creatures and players within the spell or
    ability's controller's range of influence.  If a spell or ability creates
    an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be
    recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the
    source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability's
    controller's range of influence. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Rob is within Alex's range of influence, but Carissa is not.
    Alex controls an enchantment that says, "Prevent all damage that would be
    dealt by creatures."  Carissa attacks Rob with a creature.  The creature
    deals combat damage to Rob. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Rob is within Alex's range of influence, but Carissa is not.
    Carissa casts Lightning Blast ("Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to
    target creature or player") targeting Rob.  In response, Alex casts
    Mending Hands ("Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target
    creature or player this turn") targeting Rob.  The damage to Rob is
    prevented. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: Rob is within Alex's range of influence, but Carissa is not.
    Carissa attacks Rob with a creature, and Rob blocks with a creature.  Alex
    casts Holy Day ("Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this
    turn.")  Carissa and Rob's creatures deal combat damage to each other.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  801.16 - If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that
    player's opponents within his or her range of influence lose the game
    instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 801.17 - If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw,
    the game is a draw for that spell or ability's controller and all players
    within his or her range of influence.  They leave the game.  All remaining
    players continue to play the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 801.18 - In multiplayer Planar Magic games other than Grand Melee games,
    plane cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option.  Their
    abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable
    objects and players in the game.  See Rule 901, "Planar Magic."
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

802 - Attack Multiple Players Option
  802.1 - Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple
    other players.  If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack
    only one player during a particular combat. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.2 - As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn't choose an
    opponent to become the defending player.  Instead, all the attacking
    player's opponents are defending players during the combat phase.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 802.2a - Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a "defending player"
    refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending
    players.  If the source of an ability that refers to a defending player is
    an attacking creature, it will usually refer to the player it's attacking
    or the controller of the planeswalker it's attacking.  If there are
    multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the
    ability chooses one. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a
    creature with mountainwalk.  Whether the creature with mountainwalk is
    unblockable depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  802.3 - As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, he or she
    chooses a defending player or a planeswalker controlled by a defending
    player for it to attack.  See Rule 508, "Declare Attackers Step."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.3a - Restrictions and requirements that don't apply to attacking a
    specific player are evaluated based on the entire group of attacking
    creatures.  Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a
    specific player apply only to creatures attacking that player.  The entire
    group of attacking creatures must still be legal.  See Rule 508.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.3b - Creatures in a band can't attack different players.  See
    Rule 702.19, "Banding." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.4 - If more than one player is being attacked or controls a planeswalker
    that's being attacked, each defending player in APNAP order declares
    blockers as the declare blockers step begins.  (See Rule 101.4 and
    Rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")  The first defending player declares
    all his or her blocks, then the second defending player, and so on.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.4a - A defending player can block only with creatures he or she
    controls.  Those creatures can block only creatures attacking that player
    or a planeswalker that player controls. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.4b - When determining whether a defending player's blocks are legal,
    ignore any creatures attacking other players and any blocking creatures
    controlled by other players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.5 - After blockers have been declared, if any creatures are blocking
    multiple creatures, each defending player in APNAP order announces the
    damage assignment order among the attacking creatures for each blocking
    creature he or she controls.  See Rule 510, "Combat Damage Step."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  802.6 - Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order.  Other than that, the
    combat damage step proceeds just as in a two-player game.  See
    Rule 510, "Combat Damage Step." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

803 - Attack Left and Attack Right Options
  803.1 - Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right
    rules. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  803.1a - If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an
    opponent seated immediately to his or her left.  If a player's nearest
    opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can't attack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  803.1b - If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an
    opponent seated immediately to his or her right.  If a player's nearest
    opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can't attack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

804 - Deploy Creatures Option
  804.1 - The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it
    can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams.
    Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don't
    use this option. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  804.2 - Each creature has the ability "{Tap}: Target teammate gains control
    of this creature.  Activate this ability only any time you could cast a
    sorcery." [CompRules 2009/07/08]

805 - Free-for-All Variant
  805.1 - In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as
    individuals against each other. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  805.2 - Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins.  The
    Free-for-All variant uses the following default options.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  805.2a - The limited range of influence option usually isn't used in
    Free-for-All games.  If it is, each player has the same range of
    influence, which is determined before play begins.  See Rule 801, "Limited
    Range of Influence Option." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  805.2b - Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple
    players options must be used.  See Rule 803, "Attack Left and Attack Right
    Options," and Rule 802, "Attack Multiple Players Option."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  805.2c - The deploy creatures option isn't used in the Free-for-All variant.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  805.3 - The players are randomly seated around the table.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

806 - Two-Headed Giant Variant
  806.1 - Two-Headed Giant games are played with two teams of two players
    each. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 806.2 - No multiplayer options are used in Two-Headed Giant games.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  806.3 - Each team sits together on one side of the table.  Each team decides
    the order in which its players sit.  The player seated on the right within
    each team is the primary player, and the player seated on the left is the
    secondary player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.3a - If the two players on a team can't agree on a choice, such as which
    creatures attack or what order triggered abilities are put on the stack,
    the primary player makes that choice. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.4 - The Two-Headed Giant variant has two unique features.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.4a - Each team has a shared life total, which starts at 30 life.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.4b - Each team takes turns rather than each player.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.5 - With the exception of life total, a team's resources (cards in hand,
    mana, and so on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant.
    Teammates may review each other's hands and discuss strategies at any
    time.  Teammates can't manipulate each other's cards or permanents.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6 - Timing of Team Turns [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 806.6a - A player who is dissatisfied with his or her initial hand may
    mulligan.  First, each player on the starting team declares whether or not
    he or she will take a mulligan.  Then the players on each other team in
    turn order do the same.  Teammates may consult during this process, but a
    player can't see the result of his or her teammate's mulligan before
    deciding whether to take a mulligan at the same time.  A player may take a
    mulligan even after his or her teammate has decided to keep his or her
    opening hand.  Once each player has made a declaration, all players who
    decided to take mulligans do so at the same time.  To take a mulligan, a
    player shuffles his or her hand back into his or her library, then draws a
    new hand.  In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a
    mulligan, his or her new hand is seven cards; each subsequent mulligan
    that player takes results in a hand of one fewer cards than the last.  If
    a player kept his or her hand of cards, those cards become the player's
    opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans.  This
    process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan.  (Note that if
    a player's hand size reaches zero cards, that player must keep that hand.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  806.6b - The team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6c - Teams have priority, not individual players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6d - The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see Rule 101.4) is
    modified for Two-Headed Giant play.  The team whose turn it is is the
    active team.  The other team is the nonactive team.  If both teams would
    make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active team
    makes any choices required, then the nonactive team makes any choices
    required.  Then the actions happen simultaneously. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6e - A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special
    action when his or her team has priority.  Each player on a team draws a
    card during that team's draw step.  Each player on a team may play a land
    during each of that team's turns. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6f - If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time
    a team received priority, the members of the active team put all triggered
    abilities either of them controls on the stack in any order they choose,
    then the members of the nonactive team do the same. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6g - If a team has priority and neither player on that team wishes to do
    anything, that team passes.  If both teams pass in succession (that is, if
    both teams pass without any player taking any actions in between passing),
    the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives
    priority.  If the stack is empty when both teams pass in succession, the
    phase or step ends and the next one begins. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6h - If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step
    to that player's turn, that player's team takes the extra turn, phase, or
    step.  If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that
    player's team does so.  If a single effect causes both players on the same
    team to add or skip the same step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips
    only that step, phase, or turn.  If an effect causes a player to control
    another player's turn, the controller of that effect controls the affected
    player's team's turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.6i - If an effect instructs more than one player to draw cards in a
    Two-Headed Giant game, first the primary player on the active team
    performs all of his or her draws, then the secondary player on that team
    performs all of his or her draws, then the nonactive team does the same.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7 - The Two-Headed Giant variant uses different combat rules than other
    multiplayer variants. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7a - Each team's creatures attack the other team as a group.  During the
    combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the
    active team is an attacking player.  Likewise, the nonactive team is the
    defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending
    player. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7b - Any one-shot effect that refers to the "defending player" refers to
    one specific defending player, not to both of the defending players.  The
    controller of the effect chooses which one the spell or ability refers to
    at the time the effect is applied.  The same is true for any one-shot
    effect that refers to the "attacking player." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Any characteristic-defining ability that refers to the "defending player"
    refers to one specific defending player, not to both of the defending
    players.  The controller of the object with the characteristic-defining
    ability chooses which one the ability refers to at the time the nonactive
    players become defending players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    All other cases in which the "defending player" is referred to actually
    refer to both defending players.  If the reference involves a positive
    comparison (such as asking whether the defending player controls an
    Island) or a relative comparison (such as asking whether you control more
    creatures than the defending player), it gets only one answer.  This
    answer is "yes" if either defending player in the comparison would return
    a "yes" answer if compared individually.  If the reference involves a
    negative comparison (such as asking whether the defending player controls
    no black permanents), it also gets only one answer.  This answer is "yes"
    if performing the analogous positive comparison would return a "no"
    answer.  The same is true for all other cases that refer to the "attacking
    player." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7c - As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares
    attackers.  If an effect of an object controlled by a defending player
    prohibits a creature from attacking him or her, that creature can't attack
    the defending team.  The active team has one combined attack, and that set
    of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole.  See Rule 508.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: One player in a Two-Headed Giant game controls Teferi's Moat,
    which says "As Teferi's Moat comes into play, choose a color."
    and "Creatures of the chosen color without flying can't attack you."
    Creatures of the chosen color without flying can't attack that player's
    team. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7d - As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares
    blockers.  Creatures controlled by the defending players can block any
    attacking creatures.  The defending team has one combined block, and that
    set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole.  See Rule 509.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: If an attacking creature has forestwalk and either player on the
    defending team controls a Forest, the creature can't be blocked.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7e - Once blockers have been declared, for each attacking creature
    that's become blocked by multiple creatures, the active team announces the
    damage assignment order among the blocking creatures.  Then, for each
    creature that's blocking multiple creatures, the defending team announces
    the damage assignment order among the attacking creatures.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.7f - As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how
    each attacking creature will assign its combat damage.  If an attacking
    creature would assign combat damage to the defending team, the active team
    chooses only one of the defending players for that creature to assign its
    combat damage to.  Then the defending team announces how each blocking
    creature will assign its combat damage.  See Rule 510.1.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 806.8 - The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or
    losing the game (see Rule 104), with the following additions and
    specifications. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 806.8a - Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals.
    If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game.  If
    either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game.  If
    an effect would prevent a player from winning the game, that player's team
    can't win the game.  If an effect would prevent a player from losing the
    game, that player's team can't lose the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence,
    which reads, in part, "You don't lose the game for having 0 or less life."
    If that player's team's life total is 0 or less, that team doesn't lose
    the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card
    while there are no cards in that player's library.  That player loses the
    game, so that player's entire team loses the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel,
    which reads, "You can't lose the game and your opponents can't win the
    game."  Neither that player nor his or her teammate can lose the game
    while Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the
    opposing team can win the game. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 806.8b - If a player concedes, his or her team leaves the game immediately.
    That team loses the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 806.8c - If a team's life total is 0 or less, the team loses the
    game.  (This is a state-based action.  See Rule 704.)
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  806.9 - Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player
    individually.  The result is applied to the team's shared life total.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which
    reads, "Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player."  Each team is dealt a
    total of 8 damage. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.9a - If an effect needs to know the value of an individual player's life
    total, that effect uses the team's life total divided by two, rounded up,
    instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a team is at 17 life when a player
    activates Heartless Hidetsugu's ability, which reads, "Heartless
    Hidetsugu deals to each player damage equal to half that player's life
    total, rounded down."  For the purposes of this ability, each player on
    that team is considered to be at 9 life.  Heartless Hidetsugu deals 4
    damage to each of those players, for a total of 8 damage.  The team will
    end up at 9 life. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls
    Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, "At the beginning of your
    upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game."  At the beginning
    of that player's upkeep, the player's team wins the game only if his or
    her share of the team's life total is 50 or more.  The team's life total
    must be 99 or more for that to happen. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Lurking Jackals,
    which reads, "When an opponent has 10 life or less, if Lurking Jackals is
    an enchantment, it becomes a 3/2 Hound creature."  If the opposing team
    has 22 life and 1 damage is dealt to a particular opponent, Lurking
    Jackals won't become a creature.  The opposing team's life total must
    be 20 or less for that to happen. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.9b - If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a
    number, the result is the sum of all the numbers. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Biorhythm, which
    reads, "Each player's life total becomes the number of creatures he or she
    controls."  If one member of a team that has 25 life controls three
    creatures and the other member controls four creatures, that team's life
    total becomes 7.  The first player is considered to have lost 10
    life (13 - 3), and the second player is considered to have lost 9
    life (13 - 4), even though the team didn't lose a total of 19 life.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.9c - If an effect would set a single player's life total to a number,
    that player's individual life total becomes that number.  The team's life
    total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life
    casts a spell that reads, "Your life total becomes 20."  That player's
    life total is considered to be 13 for the purpose of the spell, so it
    becomes 20 and the team's life total becomes 32 (25 + (20 - 13)).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.9d - If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life
    greater than 0 in a Two-Headed Giant game, the player may do so only if
    his or her team's life total is greater than or equal to the total amount
    of life both team members are paying for that cost or effect.  If a player
    pays life, the payment is subtracted from his or her team's life
    total.  (Players can always pay 0 life.) [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  806.10 - The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized
    teams of more than two players.  Each team's starting life total is equal
    to 15 times the number of players on the team.  (These variants are
    unofficially called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

807 - Emperor Variant
  807.1 - The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players
    each. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.2 - Each team sits together on one side of the table.  Each team decides
    the order in which it's seated.  Each team has one emperor, who sits in
    the middle of the team.  The remaining players on the team are generals
    whose job is to protect the emperor. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.3 - The Emperor variant uses the following default options.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.3a - The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for
    generals.  See Rule 801, "Limited Range of Influence Option."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.3b - Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see Rule 804).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.3c - A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to him
    or her. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: At the start of an emperor game, neither emperor can attack any
    opponents, even though both of the opposing generals are within their
    spell range. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.4 - Randomly determine which emperor goes first.  Turn order goes to
    players' left. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 807.5 - The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for
    winning and losing the game.  All other rules for winning and losing the
    game also apply.  (See Rule 104.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  807.5a - A team loses the game if its emperor loses. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 807.5b - The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its
    emperor. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
  807.6 - The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally
    sized teams.  If the teams have more than three players, the range of
    influence of each player should be adjusted. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.6a - Each general's range of influence should be the minimum number that
    allows one general from an opposing team to begin the game within his or
    her range of influence.  Each emperor's range of influence should be the
    minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the
    game within his or her range of influence.  Players should be seated such
    that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of another
    emperor. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In an Emperor game between two teams of four players each, the
    player configuration (either clockwise or counterclockwise around the
    table) should be: Team A general 1, Team A emperor, Team A general 2, Team
    A general 3, Team B general 1, Team B emperor, Team B general 2, Team B
    general 3.  Each emperor has range of influence 3.  Each general 2 has
    range of influence 2.  Each general 1 and general 3 has range of
    influence 1. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  807.7 - In the Emperor variant, a team's resources (cards in hand, mana, and
    so on) are not shared.  Teammates may review each other's hands and
    discuss strategies at any time.  Teammates can't manipulate each other's
    cards or permanents. [CompRules 2009/07/08]

808 - Grand Melee Variant
  808.1 - The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All
    variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as
    individuals.  Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or
    more players. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.2 - Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins.  The
    Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.2a - Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see Rule 801).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.2b - The attack left option is used (see Rule 803).
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.2c - The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren't
    used in the Grand Melee variant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.3 - The players are seated at random. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4 - The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the
    same time.  Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently
    taking turns.  Each turn marker represents an active player's turn.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4a - There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers.  A
    game with fifteen players has three turn markers. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4b - The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker.  The
    player four seats to that player's left (the fifth player) takes the
    second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed
    out.  Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way.  Then all players
    with turn markers start their turns at the same time.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4c - When a player ends his or her turn, that player passes the turn
    marker to the player on his or her left.  A player can't receive a turn
    marker if any player in the three seats to his or her left has a turn
    marker.  If this is the case, wait until the player four seats to his or
    her left takes the other turn marker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4d - If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra
    turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts
    his or her next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn
    marker is too close on either side at that time.  If a turn marker is
    within three seats on the player's left, the extra turn waits to begin
    until the player four seats to his or her left takes the other turn
    marker.  If a turn marker is within three seats on the player's right, the
    player passes the turn marker to his or her left when the turn ends rather
    than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately
    before his or her next turn. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4e - If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would
    reduce the number of turn markers in the game, a turn marker is removed.
    Turn markers are removed only between turns.  Remove the turn marker
    immediately to the departed player's right.  If more than one player has
    left the game and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed,
    remove the marker with the lower number. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.4f - If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the
    current turn, but that player wouldn't have a turn marker at the start of
    that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before his or
    her next turn instead. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: During Alex's turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to
    get an extra turn after this one.  During the same turn, the player to
    Alex's left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be
    reduced.  After Alex's current turn ends, his turn marker is removed.  He
    won't take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn
    the next time he receives a turn marker. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.5 - Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain
    multiple stacks.  Each turn marker represents its own stack.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.5a - A player gets priority for a particular turn marker's stack only if
    the turn marker is within his or her range of influence or an object on
    that stack is controlled by a player within his or her range of influence.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  808.5b - If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell,
    activates an ability, or a triggered ability he or she controls triggers,
    the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is
    put on.  If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability
    to trigger, the player must put it on that stack.  If a resolving spell or
    ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a
    copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack.  If a spell
    or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the
    same stack as its target; it can't target objects on multiple stacks.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]

809 - Teams Variant
  809.1 - The Teams variant involves two or more teams of equal size.
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.2 - Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins.  The
    Teams variant uses the following default options. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.2a - The recommended range of influence is 2.  See Rule 801, "Limited
    Range of Influence Option." [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.2b - Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple
    players options must be used.  See Rule 803, "Attack Left and Attack Right
    Options," and Rule 802, "Attack Multiple Players Option."
    [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.2c - The deploy creatures option isn't normally used in the Teams
    variant. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.3 - At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next
    to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
    Example: In a Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around
    the table at the start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3,
    and so on. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
  809.4 - A player can't attack opponents who aren't seated next to him or
    her. [CompRules 2009/07/08]
+ 809.5 - In the Teams variant, a team's resources (cards in hand, mana, and
    so on) are not shared.  Teammates can't review each other's hands unless
    they are sitting next to each other.  Teammates may discuss strategies at
    any time.  Teammates can't manipulate each other's cards or permanents.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

9 - Casual Variants and Tournament Rules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

900 - General
+ 900.1 - This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for
    certain casual game variants.  It is by no means comprehensive.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 900.2 - The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules,
    cards, and other game implements not used in traditional Magic games.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]

901 - Planar Magic
+ 901.1 - In the Planar Magic variant, plane cards add additional abilities
    and randomness to the game.  At any given time, one plane card will be
    face up and its abilities will affect the game.  The Planar Magic variant
    uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.2 - A Planar Magic game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
    The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack
    multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option.
    See Rule 805, "Free-for-All Variant." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.3 - In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar
    deck of at least ten plane cards and the game needs one planar die.  Each
    card in a planar deck must have a different English name.  (See
    Rule 309, "Planes.") [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.3a - A planar die is a six-sided die.  One face has the planeswalker
    symbol {P}.  One face has the chaos symbol {C}.  The other faces are
    blank. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.4 - At the start of the game, each player shuffles his or her planar
    deck so that the cards are in a random order.  Each deck is placed face
    down next to its owner's library.  All plane cards remain in the command
    zone throughout the game, both while they're part of a planar deck and
    while they're face up. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.5 - Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the
    abilities of cards that allow them to start the game with those cards on
    the battlefield, the starting player moves the top card of his or her
    planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up.  (See Rule 103.6.)
    No abilities of that card trigger as a result. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.6 - The owner of a plane card is the player who started the game with it
    in his or her planar deck.  The controller of a face-up plane card is the
    player designated as the planar controller.  Normally, the planar
    controller is whoever the active player is.  However, if the current
    planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn
    order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the
    old planar controller leaves the game.  The new planar controller retains
    that designation until he or she leaves the game or a different player
    becomes the active player, whichever comes first. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.7 - Any abilities of a face-up plane card in the command zone function
    from that zone.  The card's static abilities affect the game, its
    triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be
    activated. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.7a - Each plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you
    roll {P}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face
    down, then move the top card of your planar deck off your planar deck and
    turn it face up."  This is called the "planeswalking ability."  A face-up
    plane card that's turned face down becomes a new object.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.8 - Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but
    only during a main phase of his or her turn, that player may roll the
    planar die.  Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to
    the number of times he or she has previously taken this action on that
    turn.  This is a special action and doesn't use the stack.  (See
    Rule 114.2f.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.8a - If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens.  The active
    player gets priority. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.8b - If the die roll is the chaos symbol {C}, any ability of the plane
    that starts "When you roll {C}" triggers and is put on the stack.  The
    active player gets priority. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.8c - If the die roll is the planeswalker symbol {P}, the
    plane's "planeswalking ability" triggers and is put on the stack.  The
    active player gets priority. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.9 - When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player
    leave the game.  (See Rule 800.4a.)  If that includes the face-up plane
    card, the planar controller turns the top card of his or her planar deck
    face up.  This is not a state-based action.  It happens as soon as the
    player leaves the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.9a - If a plane leaves the game while a "planeswalking ability" for
    which it was the source is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.10 - After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of his
    or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player
    has "planeswalked."  Continuous effects with durations that last until a
    player planeswalks end.  Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks
    trigger.  See Rule 701.19. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.10a - A player may planeswalk as the result of the "planeswalking
    ability" (see Rule 309.6) or because the owner of the face-up plane card
    leaves the game (see Rule 901.9). [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.10b - The plane card that's turned face up is the plane the player
    planeswalks to.  The plane card that's turned face down, or that leaves
    the game, is the plane the player planeswalks away from.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.11 - A Two-Headed Giant Planar Magic game uses all the rules for the
    Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planar
    Magic casual variant, with the following additions. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.11a - Each player has his or her own planar deck. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.11b - The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active
    team.  However, if the current planar controller's team would leave the
    game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that
    wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar
    controller's team leaves the game.  The new planar controller retains that
    designation until he or she leaves the game or a different team becomes
    the active team, whichever comes first. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.11c - Even though the face-up plane is controlled by just one player,
    any ability of that plane that refers to "you" applies to both members of
    the planar controller's team. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.11d - Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of
    them may roll the planar die.  Each player's cost to roll the planar die
    is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled
    the planar die that turn. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.12 - In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards are
    exempt from the limited range of influence option.  Their abilities, and
    the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players
    in the game.  (See Rule 801, "Limited Range of Influence Option.")
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.13 - In Grand Melee Planar Magic games, multiple plane cards may be face
    up at the same time. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.13a - Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who
    will start the game with a turn marker moves the top card of his or her
    planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up.  Each of them is a
    planar controller. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.13b - If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game
    would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first
    ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar
    controller), then that player leaves the game.  The face-up plane card
    that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner's planar deck.
    No player is considered to have planeswalked. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.14 - Single Planar Deck Option [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.14a - As an alternative option, a Planar Magic game may be played with
    just a single communal planar deck.  In that case, the number of cards in
    the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of
    players in the game, whichever is smaller.  Each card in the planar deck
    must have a different English name. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.14b - In a Planar Magic game using the single planar deck option, the
    planar controller is considered to be the owner of all the plane cards.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 901.14c - If any rule or ability refers to a player's planar deck, the
    communal planar deck is used. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

902 - Vanguard
+ 902.1 - In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play
    the role of a famous character.  Each player will have one face-up
    vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game.
    The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the
    following additions. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.2 - A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.3 - In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a
    vanguard card.  Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner's
    library before the game begins.  All vanguard cards remain in the command
    zone throughout the game. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.4 - Each player's starting life total is 20, as modified by the life
    modifier of his or her vanguard card. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: The life modifier of a player's vanguard card is -3.  That player
    starts the game with 17 life. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.5 - Each player draws a hand of seven cards, as modified by the hand
    modifier of his or her vanguard card. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.5a - If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a
    normal game, that player shuffles his or her hand back into his or her
    library, then draws a new hand of one fewer cards than he or she had
    before.  (In a multiplayer game, a player's first mulligan is for the same
    number of cards as he or she had before.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: The hand modifier of a player's vanguard card is +2.  That player
    starts the game with a hand of 9 cards.  If the player takes a mulligan,
    he or she draws a new hand of 8 cards.  The next mulligan is for 7 cards,
    and so on. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.5b - A player's maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand
    modifier of his or her vanguard card. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: The hand modifier of a player's vanguard card is -1.  That
    player's maximum hand size is six.  If that player has more than six cards
    in his or her hand as the cleanup step begins, he or she will discard all
    but six of them. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.6 - The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with
    it in the command zone.  The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its
    owner. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 902.7 - Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone
    function from that zone.  The card's static abilities affect the game, its
    triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be
    activated. [CompRules 2009/10/01]

903 - EDH
+ 903.1 - In the EDH variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature
    designated as that deck's general.  The EDH variant uses all the normal
    rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.2 - An EDH game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.  The
    default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack
    multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option.
    See Rule 805, "Free-for-All Variant." [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.3 - Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its general.
    This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the
    card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself.  The card retains
    this designation even when it changes zones. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A general that's been turned face down (due to Ixidron's
    effect, for example) is still a general. A general that's copying another
    card (due to Cytoshape's effect, for example) is still a general.  A
    permanent that's copying a general (such as a Body Double, for example,
    copying a general in a player's graveyard) is not a general.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.4 - Each EDH deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.4a - Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its general.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.4b - Other than basic lands, each card in an EDH deck must have a
    different English name. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.4c - A card may be included in an EDH deck only if each mana symbol
    contained within its mana cost or rules text is colorless or is a color or
    colors that's in the general's mana cost. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A deck has a white-blue general.  Each mana symbol in each card
    in that deck must be white, blue, white-blue hybrid, or colorless.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.4d - A basic land card may be included in an EDH deck only if it could
    produce a color of mana that's in the general's mana cost.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
    Example: A deck has a white-blue general.  It may include basic Plains and
    basic Islands, but not basic Swamps, basic Mountains, or basic Forests.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.5 - At the start of the game, each player puts his or her general face
    up next to his or her library.  The generals start the game in the command
    zone.  Then each player shuffles the remaining 99 cards of his or her deck
    so that the cards are in a random order.  Those cards become the player's
    library. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.6 - Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets his
    or her life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.7 - The EDH casual variant uses an alternate mulligan rule.  Each time a
    player takes a mulligan, rather than shuffling his or her entire hand of
    cards into his or her library, that player exiles any number of cards from
    his or her hand.  Then the player draws a number of cards equal to one
    less than the number of cards he or she exiled this way.  Once a player
    keeps an opening hand, that player shuffles all cards he or she exiled
    this way into his or her library. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.8 - If a player would add mana to his or her mana pool of a color that
    isn't in the mana cost of his or her deck's general, that player adds
    colorless mana to his or her mana pool instead. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.9 - A player may cast a general he or she owns from the command zone.
    Doing so costs that player an additional {2} for each previous time he or
    she cast that general from the command zone that game.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.10 - If a general would be put into its owner's graveyard from anywhere,
    that player may put it into the command zone instead.
    [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.11 - If a general would be put into the exile zone from anywhere, its
    owner may put it into the command zone instead. [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.12 - The EDH variant includes the following specification for winning
    and losing the game.  All other rules for winning and losing the game also
    apply.  (See Rule 104.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]
+ 903.12a - A player that's been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same
    general over the course of the game loses the game.  (This is a
    state-based action.  See Rule 704.) [CompRules 2009/10/01]

910 - Shared Tournament Format Rules
  910.1 - Each tournament format defines what cards are included in that
    format, and any special restrictions on deck construction.
  910.2 - Formats that include recent card sets add new card sets to their
    list on the day of the set is released. [DCI Floor Rules 104 - 2007/12/20]
  910.3 - Some formats include "restricted" cards.  Cards that are restricted
    can only have one copy included in a deck, rather than the normal limit
    of 4. [DCI Floor Rules - 2003/09/01]
  910.4 - Some formats include "banned" cards.  Cards that are banned cannot
    occur in legal decks. [DCI Floor Rules - 2003/09/01]
  910.5 - All formats limit themselves to cards with a standard Magic card
    back.  This means that Collector's Edition cards, Championship and Pro
    Tour deck cards, and promotional poker cards (despite the April Fools
    article in the Duelist) are not allowed.
    [DCI Floor Rules 102 - 2003/09/01]
  910.5a - Unglued cards with a silver border are also banned from all
    formats. [DCI Floor Rules 102 - 2003/09/01]
  910.5b - Alpha printing cards can only be used if they are in unmarked
    sleeves or if the entire deck is Alpha printing.
    [DCI Floor Rules 102 - 2003/09/01]
  910.6 - A sideboard is a set of cards which is brought to the tournament
    along with your deck.  Having a sideboard is optional.
    [DCI Floor Rules 122 - 2003/09/01]
  910.6a - In constructed formats, if you have a sideboard it must consist of
    exactly 15 cards.  In sealed deck formats, all your remaining cards are
    considered your sideboard. [DCI Floor Rules 122 - 2003/09/01]
  910.6b - Players cannot look through their sideboard during play.
    [DCI Floor Rules 122 - 2003/09/01]
  910.6c - Between games, you may choose to swap cards from your sideboard
    with ones in your deck.  In constructed formats, your sideboard must still
    be 15 cards when you are done swapping. [DCI Floor Rules 122 - 2003/09/01]
  910.6d - You cannot use your sideboard before the first game of a match, and
    between matches you must reset your deck and sideboard to the same as they
    were at the start of the tournament.  Basically, you play the first game
    of each match with an unmodified deck. [DCI Floor Rules 122 - 2003/09/01]
  910.7 - Players must provide a way to visibly count life totals during play.
    For example, counters, dice, pen and paper, etc.
  910.8 - Your opponent is always entitled to shuffle or cut your deck before
    each game and each time you are called to shuffle during a game.  They may
    not use this opportunity to see the cards in your deck.  This rule is in
    place to prevent players from stacking their deck.

911 - Vintage Tournament Format
  911.1 - Decks can be composed of cards from any edition or expansion of

914 - Standard (Type 2) Tournament Format
  914.1 - Decks can be composed of cards from the most recent edition of The
    Gathering (currently Tenth Edition) and all sets from the two most
    recent "blocks" (currently Time Spiral/Planar Chaos/Future Sight,
    Coldsnap, and Lorwyn).  A "block" is a stand-alone set and the two
    expansion sets which follow it.  This means that cards stay in use for
    approximately two years. [DCI Floor Rules 125 - 2003/09/01]
    [DCI Update 2007/09/01]
  914.2 - Cards from previous editions or expansions which also appear in the
    currently legal ones are allowed. [DCI Floor Rules 124 - 2003/09/01]
  914.3 - The policy for removal of sets is that each new edition of the base
    set replaces the previous edition.  A new standalone set will start a new
    block, and thereby replace the oldest "block" in use.  A new limited
    expansion will add itself to the current "block".
    [DCI Floor Rules 124 - 2003/09/01]
  914.4 - Minimum of 60 cards in a deck. [DCI Floor Rules 121 - 2003/09/01]

    be in the combination of deck and sideboard.  Cards with different art or
    in different languages or from different prints but which are the same
    card are considered the same. [DCI Floor Rules 121 - 2003/09/01]

    packs (called starter decks in the old days) and/or booster packs.  The

    to provide one tournament pack plus two 15 card boosters.  Players may
    also exchange basic lands they have for other basic lands with the
    tournament organizer.  In addition, the organizer may make additional
    basic lands available. [DCI Floor Rules 134 - 2003/09/01]

    [DCI Floor Rules 132 - 2003/09/01]

    per player.  The judge lays out one booster pack (15 cards) on the table

    starts with the player on the judge's left and players pick one card each
    going around the table to the left.  The second booster pack goes around

    gets to the last player, they pick 2 cards and the rotation reverses
