Jake2 README
============

Jake2 is a port of the GPL'd Quake2 engine from id Software to Java. Jake2 is
distributed under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE).

The port was done completely in Java. No native libraries are used for the
game functionality. We use the lwjgl Java bindings for graphics rendering
and sound.

Jake2 is still under development. Send bug reports and feedback to
jendave@users.sourceforge.net.

Currently Jake2 supports Linux, Windows2000/XP and Mac OS X. The Jake2 dedicated
server runs on every Java supported platform.
