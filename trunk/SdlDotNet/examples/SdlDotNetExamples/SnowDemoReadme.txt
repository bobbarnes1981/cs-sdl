- About the demo

This demo is my first public demo, so don't be too cruel. It simulates some bits of snow falling down, at variable speeds and wind effects. Als there is the text of In Dreams from the Lord of the Rings.

It is written in C# with SDL.NET and should be binary compatible on all platforms supported by a .NET runtime like Microsoft .NET or mono.

The demo opens a DOS box, to display some logs. Every 5 seconds it runs it will display the framerate over those 5 seconds.

- Things that I need to do

Give a command line option for the number of snow-thingies, so one can have fun with that :P

Also I've been to lazy to change some code things...
