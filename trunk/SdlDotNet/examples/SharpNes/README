Here it is, another release of my toy to help me learn C#.  Lots more is working this time around, but lots still doesn't work.  No worries.

To run it just type:

mono sharpnes.exe [ROM name]

What it requires:

* A .NET platform (I use Mono)
* SDL (http://www.libsdl.org)
* Gtk#/Gdk# (Comes with Mono)

What it supports:

* Mappers 1 (mostly), 2, 3, 4 (mostly), 7 (partial), 9 (mostly), 10, 11 (partial), 22 (partial), 
  34, 64 (partial), 66
* SaveRAM using the .sav files other NES emulators use
* 100% clean room, no proprietary information was harmed in the making of this emulator

Keys:

* z -- A button
* x -- B button
* a -- SELECT button
* s -- START button
* f -- Fullscreen (on some platforms)
* arrow keys -- direction pad
* space -- Play/pause
