The latest version of the install process can be found at:
http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net/index.php/The_absolute_newbies_guide_to_SDL.NET

To install under Windows:

From the SDL.NET download page 
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=52340),
download this file

sdldotnet-4.x.x-setup.exe

Double-click on the installer and follow the instructions.

You can instead use the zip or gzip files

Uncompress the sdldotnet-4.x.x.zip or sdldotnet-4.x.x.tar.gz file. 
Copy the files located in the /bin/assemblies directory (SdlDotNet.dll, SdlDotNet.Particles.dll and Tao.Sdl.dll) into the Global Assembly Cache (c:\winnt\assembly).

For windows, copy the files from /lib/win32deps into a directory in your path. 
C:\winnt or c:\winnt\system32 are common choices.

If you plan to compile SdlDotNet, you will have to run one of the scripts in the /scripts directory. There are scripts to create project files for Visual Studio 2003 and Sharpdevelop.

== Installation Under Linux ==
If you are installing on Ubuntu Linux (5.10 Breezy Badger)
Add a Universe/Multiverse repository to the list in Synaptic.

Install - note that many dependencies will also be installed as a result

mono
libgdiplus
libsdl_mixer1.2
libgdiplus
libsdl-mixer1.2
libsdl-image1.2
libsdl-ttf2.0-0
libsdl-gfx1.2
timidity

You may also want to install
nant
cvs
monodevelop-boo
gcvs

* Edit the /etc/mono/config file to include these entries (from /lib/Tao.Sdl.dll.config.ubuntu)
 <dllmap dll="SDL" target="libSDL-1.2.so.0" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_image" target="libSDL_image-1.2.so.0" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_mixer" target="libSDL_mixer-1.2.so.0" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_ttf" target="libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0" />
 <dllmap dll="smpeg" target="libsmpeg-0.4.so.0" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_gfx" target="libSDL_gfx.so.0" />
 
* You may want to add these as well to run the OpenGL Demos
 <dllmap dll="opengl32.dll" target="libGL.so.1" />
 <dllmap dll="glu32.dll" target="libGLU.so.1" />

You can now build SDL.NET on Linux.

== Installation Under MacOS X ==

SDL.NET Support for OSX is minimal. SDL.NET will build but needs work to run all the examples. The main current issue is that the SDL window will not accept the focus so no keyboard or mouse events are captured by the SDL application.

* Download and install [http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX Mono for MacOS X]
* Download and install/unzip [http://nant.sourceforge.net NAnt]
# Create script called nant.sh
# chmod a+x nant.sh
# Put these lines in nant.sh
  #!/bin/sh
  exec /usr/bin/mono /path/to/nant/nant.exe "$@"
* Download and install SDL and related C libraries
# [http://http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php SDL]
# [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer SDL_mixer]
# [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image SDL_ttf]
# [http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image SDL_image]
# SDL_gfx and smpeg .dmg files are not available.
* Edit the /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/etc/mono/config file to include these entries (from /lib/Tao.Sdl.dll.config.osx)
 <dllmap dll="SDL" target="/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/SDL" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_mixer" target="/Library/Frameworks/SDL_mixer.framework/SDL_mixer" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_image" target="/Library/Frameworks/SDL_image.framework/SDL_image" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_ttf" target="/Library/Frameworks/SDL_ttf.framework/SDL_ttf" />
 <dllmap dll="smpeg" target="libsmpeg.dylib" />
 <dllmap dll="SDL_gfx" target="libSDL_gfx.dylib" />
 <dllmap dll="libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib" />
 <dllmap dll="opengl32.dll" target="/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/OpenGL" />
 <dllmap dll="glu32.dll" target="/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries/libGLU.dylib" />
 <dllmap dll="MonoPosixHelper" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Libraries/libMonoPosixHelper.dylib"/>
* Download and unzip SDL.NET
* Open up the Terminal app.
# cd /path/to/SDL.NET
# Type './nant.sh package' - This will do a complete release package build of SDL.NET including docs.
# Goto examples/Rectangles/bin/Release and type 'mono Rectangles.exe'
# The Rectangles examples will run. Also the Gears, BounceSprites and BombRun examples run, but they will not react to any keyboard or mouse events.
# The CDPlayer example requires that X11 is running.

If you plan to compile SdlDotNet, you will have to run one of the scripts in the /scripts directory. There are scripts to create project files for Monodevelop.
