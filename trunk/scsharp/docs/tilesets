tilesets are made up of 6 files.

.cv5 - tile groups
.vf4 - mini-tile "type"
.vx4 - mapping from tile to mini-tile id's (16 per tile)
.grp -
.vr4 - raster data for each mini-tile
.wpe - rgba(?) palette

.cv5 file:
----------
10 words for group values
16 words for mega tile indices

.vf4 file:
----------
1 word per mini-tile, layed out contigously in the same order as the
.vx4 file, specifying the "type" of the mini-tile.  not sure what this
means.

.vx4 file:
----------
1 word per minitile, layed contiguously in the following [x,y] order:

[0,0] [1,0] [2,0] [3,0], [0,1] [1,1] [2,1] [3,1], [0,2] [1,2] [2,2] [3,2], [0,3] [1,3] [2,3] [3,3]

if the mini-tile id & 0x1 == 0x1, flip it horizontally.
the actual mini-tile id is the word >> 1.
