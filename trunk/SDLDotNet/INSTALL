Double-click onthe installer and follow the instructions.

You can instead use the zip file

Unzip the SdlDotNet-3.1.3-1.zip file. 
Copy the files located in the /bin directory (SdlDotNet.dll and Tao.Sdl.dll)
into the Global Assembly Cache (c:\winnt\assembly).

Copy the files from /lib/win32deps into a directory in your path. 
C:\winnt or c:\winnt\system32 are common choices.

If you plan to compile SdlDotNet, you will have to run one of the scripts in the /scripts directory. There are scripts to create project files for Visual Studio 2003 and Sharpdevelop.
