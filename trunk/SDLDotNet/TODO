Future changes (as of May 2005):

* Add more sophisticated SpriteCollection and/or Sprite rendering logic (like Pygame). Instead of updating all of the sprites, we could just update the changed rectangles.
* Add more docs and tutorials.
* Create installer for windows and rpms/ebuild/debs/etc... for Linux.
* Fix build process to build on Mono.
* Work on a Mac version.
* Create custom WinForms control for Surface.

Latest changes to the C dll's.

SDL: SDL_endian.h appears to have changed, but SDL.NET does not use it. All other header files just have bug or platform fixes.
Version number has changed.

SDL_image.h: It has a new version function. Maybe I should revisit the SDL version macro as well.

SDL_mixer.h:  The version macro name has changed. however macros with the old names are present for backwards compatibility. No change needed, but will update comments so I will know to change this in future versions.

SDL_ttf.h:  The version macro name has changed. however macros with the old names are present for backwards compatibility. No change needed, but will update comments so I will know to change this in future versions.
There is a new comment showing a link to a website talking about glyph materics. I added it to the doc.

SDL_gfxPrimitives.h: The version number has changed.
SDL_imageFilter.h: several new Shift functions.
SDL_rotozoom.h: RotozoomSurfaceXY and rotozoomSurfaceSizeXY. Notably they can be used to flip a surface horzontally and vertically by using a negative number in the axis parameter. I may replace the C# versions with calls to these functions.

Smpeg: SDL_mixer 1.2.6 does not like Smpeg 0.4.4 or 0.4.5. I will stick to SDL_mixer 1.2.5 until there is a fix for Smpeg.
