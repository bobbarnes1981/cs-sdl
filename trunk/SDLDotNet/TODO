Latest changes to the C dll's.

SDL: SDL_endian.h appears to have changed, but SDL.NET does not use it. All other header files just have bug or platform fixes.
Version number has changed.

SDL_image.h: It has a new version function. Maybe I should revisit the SDL version macro as well.

SDL_mixer.h:  The version macro name has changed. however macros with the old names are present for backwards compatibility. No change needed, but will update comments so I will know to change this in future versions.

SDL_ttf.h:  The version macro name has changed. however macros with the old names are present for backwards compatibility. No change needed, but will update comments so I will know to change this in future versions.
There is a new comment showing a link to a website talking about glyph materics. I added it to the doc.

SDL_gfxPrimitives.h: The version number has changed.
SDL_imageFilter.h: several new Shift functions.
SDL_rotozoom.h: RotozoomSurfaceXY and rotozoomSurfaceSizeXY. Notably they can be used to flip a surface horzontally and vertically by using a negative number in the axis parameter. I may replace the C# versions with calls to these functions.
