Project Name: SDL.NET
Project Description: SDL.NET is a set of object-oriented .NET bindings for the SDL gaming library (http://libsdl.org) - a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D video framebuffer.

Home Page: http://cs-sdl.sourceforge.net
Current maintainer: David Hudson (jendave@yahoo.com)

Assembly:
	Name: SdlDotNet.dll
	Namespace: SdlDotNet
	Notes:
		There is one assembly. Supporting separate assemblies was too much trouble. 
		Tao.Sdl (http://taoframework.com, or http:/cs-sdl.sourceforge.net) contains 
		the low-level bindings to the six C lbraries (SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx, smpeg)

Zip file contains:
	/* - info files, Strong name keys, build/solution files.
	/bin - Assemblies
	/doc - HTML and CHM docs.
	/lib - library dependencies. Please put these libs in your path.
	/examples - demo apps for the library
	/src - source
	
		
Development Environment:
	Runtimes/Compilers:
		.NET SDK 1.1 SP1 for now.
		Future:
		Mono on Windows
		Mono on Linux
		Mono on MacOSX
		
	IDEs:
		Visual Studio 2003 - now
		SharpDevelop-  once I get dnpb set up
		VIM
		
	Tools:
		NAnt 0.85 RC1
		Nunit 2.2.0
		dnpb 0.12.2a (soon)
		
		Notes: NAnt will be the primary way to create release builds.
		Using Nunit with GUI oriented programs is problematic, 
		but I hope to use it as much as possible to reduce the ad hoc tests 
		I do on the code.

	Dependencies (make sure these are in your path):
		C libraries
		SDL 1.2.7
		SDL_image 1.2.3
		SDL_mixer 1.2.5
		SDL_ttf 2.0.6
		SPMEG 0.4.4 (coming for v2.2)
		SDL_gfx 2.0.12
		
		.NET libraries
		Tao.Sdl

		Notes: Randy Ridge of the Tao project and I worked on the native C 
		bindings for the SDL libraries and Randy
		added them to Tao. This gives the bindings and broader user base so
		additional work can be done on the bindings.
		SDL.NET will focus on the higher-level features.

Approach:
	I plan to model the API somewhat after pygame. Since pygame is a successful object-oriented wrapper around SDL, 
	it makes sense to look to pygame for inspiration. Obviously there will be areas 
	where they will differ. 
	There is also a Java-based set of bindings (JSDL). It seems to be abandoned, 
	but since Java and C# are so closely 
	related, it is worth a look.

Coding Style
	Follow .NET naming conventions. **DONE**
	CLS compliance **Done**

Tutorials
	Actually write one. :-)

TODO items:

Fix the ChannelFinished delegate.

Xedecimal
Surface.Fill(Color c); to fill an entire surface with no parameters (which could be done with a rect that takes up 0,0,w,h but this would be easier for people to use and if possible, faster) **DONE**

StretchBlit: since it isn't supported by SDL itself. 
I recently saw that the cvs version is updated quite often but no news on stretching other than YUV surfaces (video overlays?)).
That's the number 1 feature I want to implement, just a nice simple easy stretch (maybe nearest / bilinear support afterwards), also, since it only takes the x/y coordinates of the destination rect, maybe support it in the w/h of the same exact rect, checking if it doesn't match the src w/h, then again, that check would happen every single draw call so might want to just put it elsewhere and convert that into a point instead.
	
gacutil installation.

Sijmen Mulder
- Horizontal flipping **DONE**
- GetPixel/SetPixel better worked out **DONE**
- Image rotation **DONE**
- Primitive drawing (circle/line/rectangle) **DONE**
- NO animations and stuff, an engine, not a layer is meant for that **N/A**
- Things like Lock() and Unlock() should become a property 
- SDL.Instance.Video.... too much to type  **DONE**
- Multiple windows. Really. Then I will make a Managed DirectDraw implementation **WILL NOT BE DONE UNTIL SDL SUPPORTS IT**
- More .NET like things, so instead of SDL.Instance.Video.LoadBMP(filename), new Surface(filename) **DONE** 
- SDL_image integration. Surface myimage = new Surface("image.PNG"); should become possible **DONE**

Could use some sort of TextOut function for blitting to a surface.

Fix the MusicFinished delegate **DONE**

Is SDL_Delay() not implemented in the current version? **DONE**
