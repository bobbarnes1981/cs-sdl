<h2 align="center">.NET Pre-Build Instructions</h2>
<br>
.NET Pre-Build is an XML-driven pre-build tool allowing developers to easily 
generate project or make files for major IDE's and .NET development tools 
including: Visual Studio 2003, Visual Studio 2002, SharpDevelop, MonoDevelop, 
and NAnt.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>
<br>
.NET Prebuild can either be run from the command line to generate the project 
and make files or you can execute the included batch (*.bat) and Unix Shell 
script (*.sh) files. It uses an XML file (prebuild.xml by default) to define 
what projects will be generated and what their configuration, references, and 
files will be.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">Currented Supported Development Tools</h3>
The development tools which .NET Prebuild is currently capable of targeting are 
listed below with their associated batch and shell script files.
<ul>
	<li>
		Visual Studio .NET 2003 (VS2003.bat)</li>
	<li>
		Visual Studio .NET 2002 (VS2002.bat)</li>
	<li>
		SharpDevelop (SharpDevelop.bat) - http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/</li>
	<li>
		MonoDevelop (MonoDevelop.sh) - http://www.monodevelop.com/</li>
</ul>
<br>
MonoDevelop uses the same project files as SharpDevelop as it is a Unix port 
for it using the open-source implementation of the .NET Framework, Mono. A Unix 
Shell script is provided for it though, as this is far more appropriate. Visual 
Studio .NET 2005 and the Visual Express IDE's can import Visual Studio .NET 
2003 files, but native support for it will come later. NAnt and Makefiles are 
currently not supported, but will are on the roadmap as well.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3 align="center">Command Line Syntax</h3>
Example:<br />
>dnpb /target vs2003 /log ../PrebuildLog.txt<br />
<br />
<br />
This will generate the project files for Visual Studio.NET 2003 and place the 
redirect the log to a file named PrebuildLog.txt in the parent directory
<br />
<br />
The syntax structure is as below, where commandParameter is optional depending 
on the command and you can provide several option-value pairs. Note: </i>The 
'&lt;' signified the command line, do not actually enter this manually.</i> <tt>
	<pre>
>dnpb /[option] [value]
 
>dnpb /target vs2003 /pause
 
>dnpb /target vs2003 /log ../Log.txt /pause /ppo /file ProjectConfig.xml
 
>dnpb /target sharpdev /log
 
>dnpb /clean
 
>dnpb /clean vs2003
</pre>
</tt>
<br>

<h3 align="center">Command Line Options</h3>
<br />
/usage - Shows the help information on how to use .NET Pre-Build and what the 
different options are and what they do
<br />
<br />
/clean - The project files generated for the target type specified as a 
parameter for this option will be deleted. If no value is specified or if 'all' 
is specified, then project files for all the target types will be deleted.
<br />
<br />
/target - Specified the name of the development tool for which project or make 
files will be generated. Possible parameter values include: vs2003, vs2002, 
sharpdev
<br />
<br />
/file - Specifies the name of the XML which defines what files are to be 
referenced by the generated project files as well as configures the options for 
them. If not specified, prebuild.xml will be used as the default.
<br />
<br />
/log - Specified the log file that should be written to for build errors. If 
this option is not specified, no log file is generated, but if just no value is 
specified, then the defaul filename will be used for the log (DNPreBuild.log).
<br />
<br />
/ppo - Preprocesses the xml file to test for syntax errors or problems but 
doesn't generate the files
<br />
<br />
/pause - Shows the console until you press a key so that you can view the 
messages written while performing the specified actions. This allows you to 
check if an errors occurred and - if so - what it was.
<br />
<br />
/showtargets - Shows a list of all the targets that can be specified as values 
for the /clean and /target commands.

<h3 align="center">Example Batch Files and Shell Scripts</h3>
<i>Common batch and shell script files are included with .NET Prebuild source and 
	file releases.</i>
<h4>MonoDevelop</h4>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# Generates a combine (.cmbx) and a set of project files (.prjx) 
# for MonoDevelop, a Mono port of SharpDevelop (http://icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx)
./dnpb /target sharpdev /pause
</pre>
<h4>Visual Studio .NET 2003</h4>
<pre>
@rem Generates a solution (.sln) and a set of project files (.csproj) 
@rem for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2002
dnpb /target vs2003 /pause
</pre>
<br />
<i>Text after lines that start with @rem are comments and are not evaluated. You 
	can also place pause on the last line instead of specifing the /pause command.</i>
<br />
<br>
<hr />
<h3 align="center">Example XML Configuration File</h3>
<br />
<i>XML Comments (&lt;!-- Comment --&gt;) are used to markup the prebuild.xml file 
	with notes.</i>
<br />
