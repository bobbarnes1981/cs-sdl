Jake2 README
============

Jake2 is a port of the GPL'd Quake2 engine from id Software to Java. Jake2 is
distributed under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE).

The port was done completely in Java. No native libraries are used for the
game functionality. We use the jogl Java OpenGL bindings for graphics rendering
and Java OpenAL (joal) for sound. Since 0.9.4 release, Jake2 comes with an lwjgl driver
as an alternative for the jogl/joal combination.

Jake2 is still under development. Send bug reports and feedback to
jake2@bytonic.de.

Currently Jake2 supports Linux, Windows2000/XP and Mac OS X. The Jake2 dedicated
server runs on every Java supported plattform.

requirements:
400 MHz CPU
Geforce2 MX or better graphics accelerator
at least JRE 1.4 to run Jake2
at least JDK 1.5 to build Jake2 from source

Installation
------------

from binary distribution:
- run the installer with "java -jar Jake2-0.9.5-install.jar"
- follow the instructions
- change to the installation directory
- run the game with Jake2.sh or Jake2.bat
- to run Jake2 with the lwjgl OpenGL/OpenAL driver use Jake2_lwjgl.sh 
  or Jake2_lwjgl.bat

build from source:
- unpack jake2src-version.tar.gz or jake2-version.zip
- set JAVA_HOME environment variable to Your JDK1.5 installation
- run "build.sh installer" or "build.bat installer" to build the installer

installation of Quake2 data:
- if Jake2 does not detect the Quake2 files on startup you have the choice
  to select a baseq2 directory of a Quake2 installation (demo or full version)
  or to download and install the Quake2 demo files

If you want to have the latest experimental features you can grab the latest
Jake2 sources from CVS.
