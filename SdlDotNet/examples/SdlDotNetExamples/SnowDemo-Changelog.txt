Version 0.2
 - Fade out of the text
 - Fade in is now faster
 - Code cleanup for the Tekst class
 - Shadow for the text
 - Alpha transparency for flocks further away. But becausse of this, the flock image is not static anymore so it takes a huge extra amount of memory. Sorry!
 - Framerate dropped by a few percent (about 2%) because of the increased use of alpha blending.
 - Changed filenames, SneeuwDemo now runs on Linux too (filename cases were wrong...)

Version 0.1
